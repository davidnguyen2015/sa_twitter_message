He's still wrong about Sting :) https://t.co/SgqnnXStdZ.
Sting defeat the @GoderichGrizz 9-4 ... On to fullarton tomorrow night to face the @FullartonAs.
@JGoldLabel Doubt it. Rumor has it Kane may attack Lesnae because Lesnar "Put him out" Sting shows up sets up Taker vs Sting Mania 32.
@TheDoctorIsntIn Interference seems a foregone conclusion to set up a 3rd match at WM...unless Sting shows up tonight and screws Taker..
If Sting is on RAW tomorrow then there is no doubt he will confront The Undertaker to build towards a match at WrestleMania..
PWInsider reports that several sources indicate Sting flew back to New York City tonight, which could mean he appears at RAW tomorrow night..
@ShadouDoragon @HolyWhiteDragon @IronRockSaint --instead responded to Sting's statement. "Hai, Sting-san! May the guild with more--.
Sting may be apppearing tonight how many times have we heard that in the last 2 months? I'll believe it when I hear the crows.  #Raw.
@DukesWrestling if Sting is in a Rollins story line who's the next rumored 3rd man for Reigns/Ambrose?.
I gotta mute @WWE  on Monday's. Good to see Sting sucks it was in twitter. I guess back to San Andreas it is..
Sting wins title and vacates it the next night on Raw goes in to hall of fame in April.....
@mdschaeff Did you notice how the upper corners of Sting's paint were gone b/c he was in there so long?  "C'mon Seth, take it home.".
@grumpyhawk We've already been getting Christmas stuff in at work so I assume we're just prepping for Black Friday even earlier and Sting is.
@raschatz Cena with that broken nose. And if Sting is in the title chase, Paul (HHH) may have killed that Cena-Rollins feud..
@titowrestling c'mon you wouldn't mark out if Sting was champ? Granted I realize Rollins ain't dropping the strap to him but for nostalgia?.
Maybe if Sting had her on Monday his facepaint would've made it to 11pm http://t.co/yi7hKahVFC.
When it comes to weathered instruments, there's Brian May's guitar, Sting's bass, and Motorhead's Lemmy.
See they should have announced Sting's appearance last Monday beforehand. Say he will address WM and his future. Tease retirement..
@kenjude me and a Daddy Deano went to see Sting and Paul Simon. 4 blokes behind us talked for the 1st 15 mins. Absolute dicks. Why?.
Wonder if Sting will be able to speak with his actual voice on #Raw on Monday, or if they'll dub him over like a movie trailer again..
That statue's going to be demolished via Sting's bat. https://t.co/ni8VfDd5VK.

I live in perpetual fear that any of the people I interact with on a daily basis may have voted UKIP.
I guess the great British public who voted Labour instead of UKIP in May can thank their lucky stars that we don't have a Lab/SNP Gov now....
If you didn't vote UKIP in May ten you are partly responsible for what's happening in Calais today UKIP would never have tolerated it.......
People can't grasp that perphaps by sending representatives to EU parliament that aren't from Ukip, we may just wield more democratic power..
@mrpete1972 @MyTeamStorm UKIP was on media blackout for most chanels they didn't want people to know how well UKIP really did we came 2nd.
Don't worry about results tomorrow my dad got an A in politics and still ended up voting for UKIP.
@GeorgeMonbiot @offcentrenews great article.. U forgot UKIP, who will take all the votes of disaffected tories. Labour may just scrape a win.

@Bungie @BungieHelp those of us on Xbox can't even play the damn game until the 15th.... 2.0.0 isn't even 100% and it's a FAIL!.
@blowfishstudios when will the Xbox one codes be given out for gunscape? It releases tomorrow right?.
Sat down to play Xbox, remembers I have to make lunch for tomorrow. Lousy adulthood Interfering with with my mindless entertainment..
@xboxsupport1 may not be relevant but I am also an Xbox preview memeber with which we have had a couple of mysterious updates recently.
Having Xbox downloadable games always release on Wed. was such a smart move. Now, it's chaos. No idea what's out or when..

@EAAccess I have NHL 16 Deluxe Edition pre-ordered and pre-loaded on Xbox one, do I have to download again tomorrow or will it just unlock?.
@RossoneriBlog oh c'mon, you all know exactly what i meant. I never said Zlatan should be benched in 1st place. It's about possibilities..
@hello_noto01 Zlatan!  Cavani has been unhappy about playing 2nd fiddle to Ibrahimovic... He's signing a new contract! Zlatan to MUFC?.
#ManUnited #transfernews Ronaldo -Ramos - Zlatan - Muller .If you could pick one to sign tomorrow , who would it be ? http://t.co/SIPAgVJjLm.
LOL Aulas still mad about the penalty Zlatan took a 2nd time a few month ago. I'm delighted by the fact that he is still butt-hurt about it!.
Further: Zlatan is the captain of the Mon-Stars. (The plot involves him recruiting demons to take over world soccer)..
@Jon_LeGossip Thoughts about the aubameyang rumors? Cover if Zlatan leaves? Or adding depth? Augustin a good 3rd Striker for UCL quality?.
Non issue"@itsKiragu: Man U playing against PSG on Thursday, niggahs will get thrashed like shit, Zlatan and Cavani gonna castrate you".
One word from Zlatan and he will keep quiet  "@Crhedrys Lmaoooooo Hazard 3rd best? Make Zlatan catch Mourinho fes.".
so is Zlatan gonna play the 2nd half for us or nah?.
replace Zlatan with Harry Kane on 8 Aug.. #Doomed  https://t.co/jwZ5gSASRG.
@mattoak I still say it's Monday after Zlatan finishes game on Sunday... They're just prepping. They'll tease enough to gather the media..
Zlatan is a doubt for Friday's game at Lille with sprained ligaments in his knee. He had to be strapped up during the game last night. #PSG.
@JenniferWegerup Hey Jennifer. What is your source for your article about Zlatan will be in Istanbul on the 6th of aug. Thanks a lot..
@_mindy_ @RetroUnited coz of Zlatan talking how he loves a fight. May make him show LVG just how he is truly world class..
Ibra recovery time is still unknown, the French League starts on Friday. PSG will play Lille, Zlatan is very much in doubt for that..
@DivinityHope Sure, someone who scored more goals than Zlatan and Edinson would be 4th string lol you retard.
@MilanEye I didn't buy your club to invest in Zlatan. I shall visit China tomorrow &amp; gift you a china-made zlaCHAN  8) #Taekwondo #staycalm.
@MrTransferNewss @FootbaIISources considering I'm 31st, it looks like Zlatan's about to disappear..
Zlatan's 20th goal of the season not enough for who concede twice late on to draw 2-2 with Caen....
@nananavy That &amp; Zlatan insisting on playing through pain for the 2nd half vs. Lyon. Why not just come off? 2-0 up anyway..
@Jon_LeGossip Any truth to Galatasaray having made an informal offer to PSG for Zlatan? Is he fit to play this Sunday?.
OH NO, we supposedly pull out of Pedro deal as Zlatan becomes available. Please god I'll go church every Sunday if u make this not happen.
@LiLHammy97 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of De Gea. But not enough time rather try for Griezmann. Wont mind Zlatan for a year !.
@Jon_LeGossip I didn't think they will sell either. Maybe Rabiot but surely Cavani doesn't want to play 2nd fiddle to Zlatan anymore.
@Keith_Russell I don't want it to be but it may be Austin. Obviously prefer Zlatan, muller, Lewandowski etc #mufc.
We held talks with PSG on Thursday for Zlatan name now confirmed to me but this is two days old news.
If Wenger is in Paris. Could it be for Cavani or Zlatan?Then again he may be on a family break..
Goal level: Zlatan  90k by Friday? = Posting every other day  #DSGS (Vine by @ElexAuerbach) https://t.co/BPUM3A8tSD.
@YouAreMyArsenal Wouldn't surprise me if we enquired.He can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to Zlatan but he's not worth PSG asking price.
Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC.
Noooooo! I was hoping to see Zlatan being Zlatan in Tuesday! Oh well, still looking forward to the match.  https://t.co/swGyd9cQAJ.
