Sorry, Harper, but for once just take the blame. Nats' blew the game.  https://t.co/cQLmq9CofS.

But hey, if you're mad at Harper, go to the game tomorrow and tell him how you feel for all 9 innings.
Choosing to read the transcript of the interview Mansbridge did with Harper due to the extreme 2nd hand embarrassment I'm bound to endure.
@bruceanderson I feel it is 2nd rate. Mansbridge doesn't point out when Harper's not answering the question. Debaters would do that..
@newbsradio let's go easy on the pigs. I just can't stand the sight of Harper. It's the 21st century...can't we teach robots to love?.

@CBCNews Trudeau may do better if he attacked the NDP, no need to waste time on Harper the Media is 24/7 with the anti Harper narrative.
New election laws crreated by cpc makes it difficult to vote against Harper Even w/ 70% of voters against Harper, he may still win #fixed.
so Harper is blaming Del Mar racing another meet for the summer meet's struggle.  Never change California racing..
CPC polling 3rd. Hate polls but I want to believe this. As individual CPC candidates come to realize that Harper is drag to them, Distnce?.
@picardonhealth @jdvorkin Yellow journalism.  But you know?  This may be Harper's Waterloo.
Harper's NEW AD I am WHO i am not perfect but depend on me for economy  Harper slip sliding down the polls-3rd We KNOW WHO YOU ARE scares US.

I'm sat watching the worst Harry Potter film ugh.
You'd think I'd be prepared for all the anguish when reading the Harry Potter books all over again for the 10th time. Right? LIKE FUCK..
The pacing for the 4th Harry Potter movie was so ridiculously off and it ruined the entire movie..
Hey, can you set up Apple TV so I can watch Harry Potter while I get fucked up? --ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce you to my roomies!.
@itzyourboy_ if you think Harry Potter is better ur not gunna survive as an adult lol honestly though when I went to Logan 3rd was the best.
Everytime I watch the 4th Harry Potter, a part of me still thinks that maybe Cedric will return to the port-key... But he never does *cries*.
We're sat by the Thames and orally retelling Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone. I am the worst at this game..
Non stop Harry Potter in our house since Friday! Make it stop!!!.
I lost the 7th Harry Potter book....  I'm legit crying now  this is my childhood.
@ZinedineHimovic you're Floyd may weather and I'm 50 cent don't make me force you to read full sentences from Harry Potter.
Hillary doesn't want to run as Bill's 3rd term. Biden doesn't want to run as Obama's 3rd term. Both want to run as Sanders's 1st term..
@seanmdav Hillary's aides say alot of things - except the one taking the 5th. #Hillary2016.
@realDonaldTrump may not be my first choice for president, but I'm voting for him if he's nominated. At least he's better than Hillary.
Hillary whacker @MichaelSSchmidt rehashes the same article he wrote 6 weeks ago. NOT ONE new fact in Sept 7 piece..
#Obama and #Hillary may have used Benghazi lie to win his last election but the #Benghazi #truth will lose Hillary's http://t.co/iu2kLdkbXs.
This will be the 3rd "revamp" of Hillary's campaign. Her numbers tank each time. She just sucks at campaigning in the new media world..
@realdunaldtrump Wait till Hillary throws you under the bus like the rest. Pleading the 5th?.
@RufusKings1776 This must be the 20th time this old advice to Hillary has been recycled as "news."  She is who she is. That's her problem..

Hillary gets emotional over talking about her mother -  tomorrow #MorningJoe will call her a fake. @ABC.
@tbridis this why people don't believe anything Hillary say this person will soon take the 5th.
@ABCPolitics @ABC @DavidMuir OMGosh! HIllary still using her deceased Mom as a PROP to save herself from her own lies. ~May she RIP..
Hillary apologizes the way Kardashians wed--several times in quick succession &amp; never sincerely..
To look less guilty Hillary requests staffers to not plead the 5th,but use 2nd &amp; 3rd together. By: @weknowwhatsbest  https://t.co/8Spn6b7CP1.
Hillary looks as comfortable dancing with a child as she is coming out of the closet. https://t.co/A1JRg9Ac89.
Hillary: So all I have to do is have an unsecured server with national secrets on it, and I'll win? Cooooool!!! https://t.co/E3rS53QMbz.
Hillary will not make history as 1st female Pres. She'll make history by being 1st Pres candidate to be indicted on criminal charges..
@davidrook Or Hillary or Sanders.  We may have to rethink this whole democracy thing if someone does not step up after the pre-season. :D.
You may not have seen, but the left loves their liars, cheats &amp; traitors. Hillary is their perfect candidate! https://t.co/rP2z1upkwM.
Hillary just may be that stupid, look at some of her track record screw ups. History tells it all. https://t.co/nzgqhXONTl.
@KevinInABQ Also, Hillary may begin to give the perception that perhaps she may tend to allow herself to be portrayed as less than accurate..
@foxandfriends  Hillary is sorry now that she may be facing criminal charges for what they found in her email.
Remember Hillary denied a server existed  ever day ! A liar for President  like Obama this Country will not survive  https://t.co/qfrjOXgSBz.
@RealJamesWoods I hear that Hillary's Authenticity Czar is going on the Sunday shows..
Wait. People claim Hillary is showing her humanity because she chokes up talking about her dead mother? That may be the lowest bar ever..
Did anyone see Hillary's Server Boy actually plead the 5th or did his Lawyers only do this in the media? @TGowdySC @greta @zerohedge.
Hillary can take her phony apology and shove it where the sun doesn't shine. She is only sorry she was caught it's all about power..
@OutnumberedFNC @ainsleyearhardt Hillary's 1st Tele News explan "The server I used was set up by the Secret Service 4 the Pres" Y 4gotten???.

Fuck a Saturday class I just wanna go home and play with our squirrel and watch Jurassic Park.
fuck me I took so long to watch jurassic park and kept pausing it and then I sat on the remote and it changed channels and now its live tv.
Stayed up late to watch Jurassic World and I just remembered I have a football match tomorrow morning :/.
I have the worst urge to watch Jurassic World for the 4th time in theaters someone make it stop.
We tried to watch Jurassic World and watched like an 8th and the Internet died on us :(.
Sat through Jurassic World w/ a screaming baby in my ear + a 6 year old climbing up the back of my chair. Ruined my experience @AMCTheatres.

Lucian Favre having 2nd thoughts about Gladbach qualifying for the Champions League - Juventus, Man City and Sevilla. Group Of Death..
87 years of Italian Serie A history produced a first for Juventus on Sunday: they lost at home on the opening day of the season.
@mast84 how much more? (to be clear I hate Juventus) but this move doesn't make sense. They may offer 40 million to reach a deal so quickly.
Consult a Dr. If you will watch the 2nd half of Swansea vs ManUtd over Roma vs Juventus match @ 7:00.
Only going by the latest game stats but think I may have made a mistake backing juventus.
As things stand, the bottom 3 in Serie A are Bologna (18th), Empoli (19th); and Juventus (20th)..
This is very bad for Juventus. Lose in the 1st &amp; 2nd gionarta? something wrong with formation i think.. miss Pirlo, Tevez &amp; Vidal already :(.
Juventus had two men sent off as their dismal start to defending their Serie A title continued with defeat at Roma on Sunday..
De Rossi believes Juventus may struggle to cope this season as he does not think they have adequately replaced Tevez, Pirlo or Vidal.
If Draxler news is true, Juventus has been humiliated this transfer window. May be leaving without the trequartista they need and 0-2..

Americans taken hostage by Iran Houthis back in march ..Kerry kept it quiet while Iran deal was being negotiated  so Americans would approve.

@musikate @catawu @cmbsweden @verge sorry her shenanigans eclipse any real talent she may have..at least Madonna was strategic w/shenanigans.
@THR She has the right to disagree. I hate Madonna! But don't think she should be stopped singing her shitty songs. 1st amendment, bro!.

if you can't handle me blasting mariah carey fantasy on repeat with all of the windows open on a sunday arvo then don't live in rosebery nsw.
Mariah Carey: "I really haven't paid attention to Madonna since about like 7th or 8th grade, when she used to be popular." MELHOR SHADE.
@lhommegirl @arzE fukkin loser it's totally abt Mariah Carey however studies show now she may be one-upped by u.
It is almost 2 o'clock in the morning, I have school tomorrow and my roommate is singing Mariah Carey at the top of his lungs in the shower..
Misinterpreting Mariah Carey lyrics. Apparently she wants to fly a family into the sun and something about tachyon beams. Star Trek fan ?.
I really haven't paid attention to Mariah Carey since I was like in 5th grade when she used to be popular.

@kewldoode72 Will be interesting to see if  Sony addresses the heat issues in the Z5 - it may have found a work around.

@leboism @DeadshirtDotNet foolish mortal, I have sat through TEEN WOLF *and* TEEN WOLF TOO, nothing you can do can harm me anymore.
Oh just realized that there was no teen wolf today :((((((((( MAJOR MISSING :(((( January'16. &lt;&lt; SO LONGGGGG.

It's already Friday. Not the TGIF kind of Friday... Can time freeze for a while?.
And I don't know about TGIF. Fridays are terrible. I'm more of a TGIS person. Can it be Saturday already?.
Everyone's like TGIF!  And I'm over here like I work tonight. And a double tomorrow. And Sunday. And monday.  #grindin #needmoney.
...and TGIF!!! What a week... I really dislike the 1st and the 3rd..
Yesterday was lastweek,and TGIF was two days ago,which was also last week, so how the hell is tomorrow monday?.
this bitch said "TGIF" and it's Monday....
TGIF is totally meaningless when you have to work on Saturday..just sayin;)#PSYBringItOn.
@thorharris666 or "happy Monday" or "TGIF" or... How about we all just shut the fuck up for a bit? The animals will appreciate it..
I prefer TGIS than TGIF now. Cause friday is always a stressful day.
@GCTigerTracker - ONCE AGAIN TIGER WOODS SHITS THE DAMN BED ON A  SATURDAY, SUNDAY OR BOTH (which BOTH is what it is most of the time).
Tiger Woods is the biggest tease of the entire weekend. In contention and blows it on Sunday. Next step play 72 holes instead of 54..

Why does Tom Cruise take 10,000 times to figure things out in the movie Edge Of Tomorrow, but gets it right 1st time in Mission Impossible?.
I would have enjoyed Edge of Tomorrow more if Tom Cruise had to start each day by re-spawning in the bathroom of a Bubba Gump Shrimp..
@gregthepaladin @padgettish @bootaide I mean it's 5th in a series, I don't expect perfection from that or Tom cruise just good action.
@pecunium Edge of Tomorrow was Yet Another Tom Cruise Movie, which is to say it was too long, blew up too much shit, &amp; needed a better end..

After all these Tsipras headlines, I wonder if they'll still let the Athens Stock Exchange open tomorrow. Will be a total bloodbath..
@NormalCommunity @Ypatia1 Thanks. I reckon Tsipras may be heading for the top three of the world's most disingenuous politicians..
@steve_hanke Tsipras is currently on holidays and on the 6th he is going to Egypt. So i dont think he realizes the situation we are in.
Tsipras - "talks are in final stretch"  which is Greek for "talks are about to break down and I may call a referendum any minute now".
No big deal, Tsipras reminds his admirers all over the world.  If possible, a 2nd emasculation won't be opposed by him..
@BritainFirst It's like Tsipras says, they're in the middle of a humanitarian crisis. BF should have their march cancelled, and the money.
@Hugodixon "more moderate" may be! But plenty of uneducated demagogs, who have not done a day's work....Starting  with Tsipras, himself!.

@fronteratech are you for real? UKIP supported austerity in their manifesto! in a byelection in Cornwall last night you went from 1st to 4th.
If you did not vote UKIP in May then you are a major part of the illegal immigrant problem and no part at all of the solution......
@martyj21 https://t.co/ulJsErILMH Idiots attracted to all parties. Difference with UKIP is media prepared to dig through years of profiles;.
There's a simple solution, just deport all the far right wing Tory &amp; UKIP voting cocksuckers ! https://t.co/kfAn0Z7S15.
@LordAshcroft went to UKIP and ppl wont be fooled twice with weasel words I wont vt 4 them again it will b 1st time in 70yrs DC deceitful..
@Independent Backed by The Sun &amp; closest to UKIP - What does this say about the UK electorate! Bigots United!.
FFS. Enough. Fuck the Daily Mail, The Sun, UKIP, Front National and all other reactionary purveyors of hatred.... http://t.co/jTrLHGCHxh.
@meldrum @iainmartin1 65-70% of Tory &amp; UKIP voters still want to renationalise the railways, as do the 1st &amp; 2nd place cands for Lab Leader..
@EyesWatchin you may not like Corbyn but to retweet UKIP supporters is worse. More tory than the tories.
May continues to disguise her "UK out of EU" view. She should do the honourable thing and resign and join UKIP. https://t.co/vQfaLYG4g6.
@sweeneyuk1 @roxley @DouglasCarswell @Telegraph that's the problem with UKIP, they want all other EU countries to put UK citizens above 1st..
Theresa May Calls For Curbs To EU Free Movement and usurps many UKIP ideas in the process: http://t.co/j1fZfP89pm.
@pperrin @nellesapelle Very wise. Hard to see UKIP going any further tho. Lab &amp; Tory split may open up new space like you said..
So Twitter, who do you think will be 1st Labour MP to announce they are leaving for UKIP on September 12th?? #JezWeCan.
My Ma's so fucking UKIP. She may as well be smoking Bensons and sipping John Smith's ale as she's giving off about the Chinese.
UKIP may be out of the news but they are as poisonous as ever https://t.co/5MI5s1BvDK One of their parliamentary candidates.
UKIP boy may have deleted his Twitter profile, but those screenshots will be with him forever..
@Tweet4Labour UKIP polled 2nd in Labour-held seats in the north, if we continue with Tory-lite policies then UKIP will crush us in the north.
@GudBadAnFozzy @davidsmith42000 @LBC You said he was the 2nd worst, he isn't &amp; UKIP don't vote on non-UK issues.
@paulwaugh to be fair Paul, after SNP, UKIP, Boundary changes &amp; 50 fewer MPs, it may not be leader that's influencing the 80% who disagree.
@BaronGraham I understand why people may support them, but I totally despise UKIP. They're racist bigoted beasts, nothing average about that.
The same ppl who voted UKIP in May are only defending migrants coming to the UK because it seems like the 'conscientious' or 'right' answer..
If there were an election tomorrow,UKIP still wouldnt get a great number of MP's,I hate to say it but I think this country is about finished.
Deplorable and wrong-headed comments by Bristol's only UKIP councillor. I hope he loses his seat in May and UKIP fold http://t.co/l4k1GggRlm.
@joerexrode Sorry, Joe, but the only way this team finishes 7th in the Big Ten would be major injuries to Valentine, Harris and Tum....
@steve196508 Evrn worse for people born around 14th November. Just the result of a Valentine's shag..
Valentine's day may be rather depressing for me but I barely get to see this....
I hope that guy goes all out for Valentine's Day. The fkn works. Then a few days before feb 14 he checks her phone, and sees a few messages.
One of the infinite reasons why valentine's day is the worst holiday in human existence https://t.co/rTXBO4Dj1x.
They think cause they said some vague shit on that Friday in December that when Valentine's day comes around and they're with another girl.
This was the last Sunday without #NFL #football until Valentine's day..
I think I posted surprise incest in the Golden Sun fanfic category once on Valentine's Day. I was a terrible person..
@ruraljules If it makes you feeling any better....I got dumped by my 1st boyfriend, by note, right before Valentine's Day. :\.
I get way too hype about October fuck February Halloween is my Valentine's Day.
Dumbass christian thought Valentine's Day was on the 13th... Bye.
Ruble sliding again today, with dollar cracking above 64 rubles, for first time since Valentine's Day in February. http://t.co/sL7ZYvAGC5.
But then i remembered she's the same hoe that never gave me a Valentine's Day card back in the 4th grade AND stole my scented eraser..
The world will end on February 14 in the year 2016. "Valentine's Day. Bummer." http://t.co/vDMMKsq82d.
900 Jews were burnt alive on 14 February 1349 in the "Valentine's Day" Strasbourg massacre, where the plague had not yet affected the city.
Get me Valentine's Day hearts for Feb. 14 and I'm taking it as a sign you're breaking up with me. Love won't make you eat those things..
This is the last agonizing Sunday of the year. No more of these until Valentine's Day..

I wonder if my 3rd attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 will be the charm. I sure hope so it's taking several hours for each attempt..
so the Windows 10 upgrade may mean that various assistive technology softwares financed by DSA don't work? Awh what? http://t.co/0ZISCtaIxm.
Photos may not come tonight. Updated to Windows 10, reset computer and now it doesn't remember which photos it has and is currently 1/2.
Intended to finish my Windows 10 slides for the Aug @NelaInfoSec event.  Couldn't connect SP3 to internet; gave up.  Must complete tomorrow..

So apparently Sony VAIO laptops pre-installed with Windows 7 probably won't receive Windows 10 drivers until after November. #uninstallahoy.
Fuck it, I think it may be time to give Windows 10 a try.  Once I finish this download, it's time to nuke this shit from orbit..
BEWARE - if you do not have to upgrade to Windows 10 you may want to think twice before you do. We would warn you... http://t.co/B1iSmtLihL.
I'm in the process of updating to Windows 10. Close your home windows, wherever you are.....my screams may soon be deafening..
Upgrading to Windows 10 may be the worst computer-related decision I've made since deciding to play Neopets instead of going to class..
1st blue screen of death in abt 7yrs and it happens aftr updating to Windows 10.Microsoft...*sigh* thought yall asses had it together by now.
Grandma's hiring some dude to work on her computer tomorrow.....  A bit worried.. he might try to get her to install Windows 10..
Serato DJ isn't compatible with Windows 10 yet :( ...got to spin on my old laptop Saturday..
Just spent 5 hours babysitting my 5th attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 without success. Not sure what's wrong, but it's getting ridiculous..
anyone having problems with Windows 10? may be coincidental but since i downloaded, my WiFi keeps dropping out. Itunes had a malfunction.
@AllAllen7 If the issue only occurs with Windows 10 and not your other PC or device. It sounds like the issue may be with Windows 10..
Upgrading to Windows 10. Might not be recording tonight after all. May need to cancel tomorrow night's stream to record Fable..
My AD/DA interface drivers just went BOOM!  It seems Microsoft is forcing me to upgrade to Windows 10. I may gone some time....
@squeejay this is on Windows 10, may have something to do with it; everything else is also slower than sh** through a funnel since 'upgrade'.
Microsoft needs to get their shit together. Xbox live just went down for a 2nd day, what a fucking surprise @XboxSupport  #xboxlive.
@XboxSupport abt time we got a reply from xbox 4 hours and counting, this is the 3rd time in a month what u doing to fix this issue xbox.
@thepieface I hate it more. My Xbox controller is in London so I can't play until sunday.
@MrTLexify my Xbox box live expired last Friday the struggle are real.
Just sitting here staring at my Xbox waiting for the #Destiny update to finish downloading. 30 + minutes. I may die waiting....
What will the Destiny 2.0 patch be at when I get home? 70% 48%? 95%? 2%? Who knows. My Xbox may just be on fire the way things were going..
@BungieHelp I've sat here since 7 its now 1am and it has moved 2% i'm off if it's not done when I wake I'll be ringing xbox for a refund..
@KonamiSupport yo wtf why can't you fix the severs on Xbox one for fob it's September 9th and again can't get on.
This may be our last chance to see Zlatan in the World Cup and FIFA totally fucked it up. Shocker..
Friend with connections just offered to let me meet Zlatan &amp; Co. in NJ tomorrow. Alas, my body sucks and I cannot..
So, about Zlatan... I don't want him. All reports are that he's not a good teammate. He'd be our 3rd DP Fwd, how do you work the 3 together?.
@OccupyBears he fancied rolling the ball to Zlatan on the edge of the box early on and then he totally fucked up for PSG's 1st goal....
fucking cunt. I hope he eats Zlatan's shit in retirement league. https://t.co/blH85NzExz.
@MinoRaiola just because your hunger for more money Zlatan will play in a team that finished at the 10th place and struggle for top 5,shame.
Watching a replay of the PSG / Lille match from Friday. No Zlatan makes PSG unwatchable..
@ACMilanNorway anyway, telling Zlatan he'll be the center of the team is like telling the sun it's the center of the solar system. No crap..
The top 4 strikers in the world are not for sale and our coach can't handle the 5th (Zlatan).
Today United should have done better, the referee didn't help at all!!!!  Rooney to 10 pls! Just sign Zlatan tomorrow pleeeeeeze.
If there is a silver lining this shows LVG if we dont buy anyone b4 Tuesday we is fucked!! Fuck it i would take Zlatan!!.
