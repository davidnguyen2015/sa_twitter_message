#timesofindia .neymarjr may make Barca return against Malaga: Coach http://t.co/wowKAmUExs via TOISportsNews http://t.co/YdgpPvhn2S.
Yo! Chelsea! remember when Barca said Fabregas was poo poo in the 2nd half of the season. No refunds.
Vermaelen starting for Barca 2nd time in a row. Didnt think he'd play that much for them..
@mediocentroEN that he's a 4th choice CB at Barca and has started two games?.
@noelle_cruz Think they put him number 3/4 These Sky Sports Pundits are pro Barca,  spent ages talking about Messi's win on Thurs..
We now just need less than 4.5 goals in the Barca match and Real match to land the 32/1 7-fold. I may cover our bet before the last match.
I hope that Barca does a lot more better in the 2nd half then in the 1st half..
I honestly think what we're seeing with Fabregas is really him and why Barca were quick to part ways. Last August-November was a one-off.
I can't believe the last time Barca scored against Malaga was in January 2014, that's odd. My money on Malaga to win tonight #bbceurofooty.
Pedro sat bench for Barca &amp; KDB wins POTY in Germany but yet Pedro is the "better" player..
Barca on the other hand could have problems. Must avoid injuries and stay in touch til Jan and probably add 2 more on top of Arda an Vidal.
@OldTraffordReds I look at his past record 2 n it's awful nearly got barca relegated nearly finished 5th wif bayern b4 he got sacked.
@RafaelH117 @DianaKristinne  do you guys think if Barca reaches January as leaders they can win the League and whether team can achieve that.
@EPHowie Did you not see my reply? Barca's front 3 tomorrow. Don't EVEN @ me..
@lewis59453181 yer some Argentinian kid from Barca is flying in tomorrow, apparently Traore has told him it's good at villa..
@_suprene @sinTripas_ if he can play then I hope he plays against barca, on the 20th.
So De Gea will be just like the Barca situation, can't play but is basically at the club because he should leave when January comes.
If DDG is stuck here till Jan, can we offer him to Barca just to annoy Madrid even more..
Madrid and Barca run the La Liga, not a chance DDG won't be a Madrid player by tomorrow..
Of course it will be, When Barca can sign a player inspite being banned from signing, Why not Real get 1 minute. https://t.co/c6kXXMyfFb.
@halamufc @swagattt @joelsimondsouza Personally I think Utd should just tell Madrid, the deal is gone and then in January sell DDG to Barca.
Barca fans when they saw "UEFA will study the case tomorrow. They will make a decision on the De Gea case" http://t.co/BmV0wbjeoy.
@tigeramer10 @SergeMUFC .. Which they won't do as they are facing a transfer ban akin to Barca. Even De Gea going January misses the CL..
Barca won the treble and had a transfer ban yet they signed two players. Arsenal came 3rd in the BPL and they didn't buy an outfield player.
@The__Fundraiser Barca turned down the opportunity and experimented with Suarez. Bayern haven't opened a cheque yet[Have 1st preference].
Ben Lederman may well end up being the first American to play for Barca but, for the time being, it sounds like he's heading to Florida..
@bluekippercom @edmunddafox he's off to barca in January.
Atletico Madrid is going to be dangerous..Pedro leaving is going to hurt Barca in the long run..no bench to rest MSN https://t.co/TD02TABov8.
.@http://pinurl.co/MakeMoneyWithGooglejr may make Barca return against Malaga: Coach http://t.co/u00NuZqQAt.
Yea, just play for U21 when the club asks, u may had won a lot wit Barca but that is past, tis is Unitedddd(Spartaa) https://t.co/E2H731h3uZ.
Can only mean one thing: he is joining Barca - probably in January..
@FCBMJohnKJ psg could be the 2nd best team in the world behind Barcelona but they always get Barca lol, so we would never know.
@haidar_altaie @FootyQuestions1 Exactly. Only reason Torres even came back into the lime-light were for 1st minute goals vs Madrid &amp; Barca.
Arda Turan got cramp, I am not surprised! Sign for Barca but can't play til January, what do you expect lol.
@andrewmperry the thing though is if pogba ever does leave juve it will be to barca, also my team isn't in 13th place right now..
We are not Real Barca or Bayern that players would be ready to join the club as a 2nd/ 3rd choice. On what grounds would you bench Coq/Santi.
Neymar was always gonna be something special. I honestly hate his role at Barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to Messi.
Barca want midfielder, forward in January http://t.co/aYwD4sNFpm.

I stand with Harper on this. You shouldn't be leaving in the 7th on what essentially is a playoff game. It's not like the game went.
There's only one Minister in Harper's pantheon, and he's 100% Prime... (May contain Antibiotics, HGH, GMO...) https://t.co/8zE5Va8HiX.
yeah, Harper went 0-3 tonight. that doesn't mean he doesn't have every right to call out every single fake nats fan that left in the 7th.
Watch Harper's toupee suddenly look alot cheaper Oct 20 when our taxes are no longer paying for it. #elexn42.
Now that he's in 3rd place in polls, Harper unveils inspiring new slogan: "I'm not perfect." Circling the drain time. #elxn42 #cdnpoli.

@jenditchburn It's happened. Harper may try again. What said last night won't matter, it's cling 2 power by whatever means or pogey. #elxn42.
@jenditchburn Harper's a 1 trick pony.  Throwing $ from a helicopter doesn't make up for clear lack of CPC vision.  3rd place &amp; dropping..

Do #mets walk Harper if rendon gets bunt down?  Is Matt Williams under the weather? Pap in 8th facing bottom of order? Left storen out 2 dry.
Harper doesn't want to see you leave unless you're stretchered off. #brutal  https://t.co/EKEi9TOC4A.
@SBNationMLB @SBNation The idea that the Mets would have walked Harper if it was 1st/2nd no outs in lunacy..

@EAAccess I have NHL 16 Deluxe Edition pre-ordered and pre-loaded on Xbox one, do I have to download again tomorrow or will it just unlock?.
@RossoneriBlog oh c'mon, you all know exactly what i meant. I never said Zlatan should be benched in 1st place. It's about possibilities..
@hello_noto01 Zlatan!  Cavani has been unhappy about playing 2nd fiddle to Ibrahimovic... He's signing a new contract! Zlatan to MUFC?.
#ManUnited #transfernews Ronaldo -Ramos - Zlatan - Muller .If you could pick one to sign tomorrow , who would it be ? http://t.co/SIPAgVJjLm.
LOL Aulas still mad about the penalty Zlatan took a 2nd time a few month ago. I'm delighted by the fact that he is still butt-hurt about it!.
Further: Zlatan is the captain of the Mon-Stars. (The plot involves him recruiting demons to take over world soccer)..
@Jon_LeGossip Thoughts about the aubameyang rumors? Cover if Zlatan leaves? Or adding depth? Augustin a good 3rd Striker for UCL quality?.
Non issue"@itsKiragu: Man U playing against PSG on Thursday, niggahs will get thrashed like shit, Zlatan and Cavani gonna castrate you".
One word from Zlatan and he will keep quiet  "@Crhedrys Lmaoooooo Hazard 3rd best? Make Zlatan catch Mourinho fes.".
so is Zlatan gonna play the 2nd half for us or nah?.
replace Zlatan with Harry Kane on 8 Aug.. #Doomed  https://t.co/jwZ5gSASRG.
@mattoak I still say it's Monday after Zlatan finishes game on Sunday... They're just prepping. They'll tease enough to gather the media..
Zlatan is a doubt for Friday's game at Lille with sprained ligaments in his knee. He had to be strapped up during the game last night. #PSG.
@JenniferWegerup Hey Jennifer. What is your source for your article about Zlatan will be in Istanbul on the 6th of aug. Thanks a lot..
@_mindy_ @RetroUnited coz of Zlatan talking how he loves a fight. May make him show LVG just how he is truly world class..
Ibra recovery time is still unknown, the French League starts on Friday. PSG will play Lille, Zlatan is very much in doubt for that..
@DivinityHope Sure, someone who scored more goals than Zlatan and Edinson would be 4th string lol you retard.
@MilanEye I didn't buy your club to invest in Zlatan. I shall visit China tomorrow &amp; gift you a china-made zlaCHAN  8) #Taekwondo #staycalm.
@MrTransferNewss @FootbaIISources considering I'm 31st, it looks like Zlatan's about to disappear..
Zlatan's 20th goal of the season not enough for who concede twice late on to draw 2-2 with Caen....
@nananavy That &amp; Zlatan insisting on playing through pain for the 2nd half vs. Lyon. Why not just come off? 2-0 up anyway..
@Jon_LeGossip Any truth to Galatasaray having made an informal offer to PSG for Zlatan? Is he fit to play this Sunday?.
OH NO, we supposedly pull out of Pedro deal as Zlatan becomes available. Please god I'll go church every Sunday if u make this not happen.
@LiLHammy97 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of De Gea. But not enough time rather try for Griezmann. Wont mind Zlatan for a year !.
@Jon_LeGossip I didn't think they will sell either. Maybe Rabiot but surely Cavani doesn't want to play 2nd fiddle to Zlatan anymore.
@Keith_Russell I don't want it to be but it may be Austin. Obviously prefer Zlatan, muller, Lewandowski etc #mufc.
We held talks with PSG on Thursday for Zlatan name now confirmed to me but this is two days old news.
If Wenger is in Paris. Could it be for Cavani or Zlatan?Then again he may be on a family break..
Goal level: Zlatan  90k by Friday? = Posting every other day  #DSGS (Vine by @ElexAuerbach) https://t.co/BPUM3A8tSD.
@YouAreMyArsenal Wouldn't surprise me if we enquired.He can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to Zlatan but he's not worth PSG asking price.
Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC.
Noooooo! I was hoping to see Zlatan being Zlatan in Tuesday! Oh well, still looking forward to the match.  https://t.co/swGyd9cQAJ.
