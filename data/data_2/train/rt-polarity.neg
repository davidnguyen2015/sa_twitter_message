@UtdRantcast @br_uk do you think Chelsea deadline day bid was real or just spin by mufc to try and justify the fee? Think it may be latter.
No blues starting for England! Sound for Saturday, Chelsea are getting fucked and Jose knows it.
With Chelsea's poor start to the season it could be 3 points to the 'ammers on October 24th - and I'll be there to see it.
@Dan_Walsh18 c'mon bruh, you watch Chelsea every week you aren't actually gonna tell me that Oscar works harder due to tackles are you?.
Everton Vs. Chelsea so early on a Saturday. These boys want to ruin my weekend. Why Lord..
@889BrilaFM Chelsea poor form is attributed 2 Jose Mounrinh as he kept faith wid jst d 1st eleven widout putin confidence in his subs. #LHSC.
Really hope Chelsea start Baba instead of Ivanovic on Saturday, he's literally aged about 5 years over the summer.

@therealgokwan what I hate is when the sun brings out the men who think they look like David Beckham but dont..put it away!!.
@RealRazor but then he'll be sat on his arse at home or else playing in conference. He's crap and thinks he's David Beckham..
3rd day in LA, STILL not seen David Beckham.
Why is the David Beckham so positive about the England team, we are shite if we don't hit 8/9 on Sat then that is disgraceful set of cretins.
David Beckham has expressed his desire to be the next James Bond. He's a good look but his acting may be a deal breaker.

@tbridis this why people don't believe anything Hillary say this person will soon take the 5th.
@ABCPolitics @ABC @DavidMuir OMGosh! HIllary still using her deceased Mom as a PROP to save herself from her own lies. ~May she RIP..
Hillary apologizes the way Kardashians wed--several times in quick succession &amp; never sincerely..
To look less guilty Hillary requests staffers to not plead the 5th,but use 2nd &amp; 3rd together. By: @weknowwhatsbest  https://t.co/8Spn6b7CP1.
Hillary looks as comfortable dancing with a child as she is coming out of the closet. https://t.co/A1JRg9Ac89.

You may not have seen, but the left loves their liars, cheats &amp; traitors. Hillary is their perfect candidate! https://t.co/rP2z1upkwM.
Hillary just may be that stupid, look at some of her track record screw ups. History tells it all. https://t.co/nzgqhXONTl.
@KevinInABQ Also, Hillary may begin to give the perception that perhaps she may tend to allow herself to be portrayed as less than accurate..
@foxandfriends  Hillary is sorry now that she may be facing criminal charges for what they found in her email.

Did anyone see Hillary's Server Boy actually plead the 5th or did his Lawyers only do this in the media? @TGowdySC @greta @zerohedge.
Hillary can take her phony apology and shove it where the sun doesn't shine. She is only sorry she was caught it's all about power..

Stayed up late to watch Jurassic World and I just remembered I have a football match tomorrow morning :/.
I have the worst urge to watch Jurassic World for the 4th time in theaters someone make it stop.
We tried to watch Jurassic World and watched like an 8th and the Internet died on us :(.

Lucian Favre having 2nd thoughts about Gladbach qualifying for the Champions League - Juventus, Man City and Sevilla. Group Of Death..
87 years of Italian Serie A history produced a first for Juventus on Sunday: they lost at home on the opening day of the season.
@mast84 how much more? (to be clear I hate Juventus) but this move doesn't make sense. They may offer 40 million to reach a deal so quickly.
Consult a Dr. If you will watch the 2nd half of Swansea vs ManUtd over Roma vs Juventus match @ 7:00.
Only going by the latest game stats but think I may have made a mistake backing juventus.
As things stand, the bottom 3 in Serie A are Bologna (18th), Empoli (19th); and Juventus (20th)..
This is very bad for Juventus. Lose in the 1st &amp; 2nd gionarta? something wrong with formation i think.. miss Pirlo, Tevez &amp; Vidal already :(.
Juventus had two men sent off as their dismal start to defending their Serie A title continued with defeat at Roma on Sunday..
De Rossi believes Juventus may struggle to cope this season as he does not think they have adequately replaced Tevez, Pirlo or Vidal.
If Draxler news is true, Juventus has been humiliated this transfer window. May be leaving without the trequartista they need and 0-2..

Still bitter that they didn't tweet about MetLife&amp;now Augustana is opening the show tomorrow night. Just keep giving me reasons to be bitter.
@kewldoode72 Will be interesting to see if  Sony addresses the heat issues in the Z5 - it may have found a work around.
@bollybrit @itsnacool both of webb ones made less money than the 3rd Raimi one, plus the success of Marvel had Sony scared i think.
And in comes Sony with the letdown. Only one color. Clap it up... low and slow https://t.co/6jaRCgfvTP.
Exactly why I'll never buy Sony. Those 1st class ass kissers are dick pulling the media for high scores on future games. LOL. @tomwarren.
@The_CrapGamer Sony don't care about their exclusives they never made a theme console for their exclusives https://t.co/ft9VpAxSjs.
I got no love for Sony. They can disappear tomorrow,someone else would just replace them and try harder for consumers. @Gaming_forever1.
@strunk_daddy For any info you would need to contact Sony. Apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused ^AI.
Still waiting for my phone to come back from Sony..bit lost without it. Hopefully back up by Thursday. Last upload was from my PC..

@WithYouRebelX I've had problems with my email and haven't received any information for Saturday's Star Wars secret cinema. Can you resend?.
#ForceFriday as a whole was pretty disappointing. Not sure who dropped the ball - retailers, Hasbro, or Disney. It's Star Wars! C'mon!.
@alexkidwell I give zero shits about Star Wars, and I'm only mildly excited by Bond films. Will I be seeing you on RHAP tomorrow?!.
@BitterOldJoe it gave the impression the whole thing is a beery deconstruction of Star Wars for adult edgelords. I may read it anyway.

Ted 2 was shit, ant-man was dec now it's time for southpaw!.
Ted 2 was a disappointment considering how much i loved the 1st. The Gollum part was hilarious though.

Teen wolf season 5 just premiered but where is it tomorrow   Oh yeah  Not here.

If you're having a good day just remember that Teen Wolf isn't on tomorrow..
So its a monday with out TEEN WOLF wtf am I supposed to do @ReallyCody @CODYSAINTNEW @tylergposey @dylanobrien @DSprayberry @MelissaPonzio1.

The fact that it's Monday and teen wolf isn't on makes me sad.

Monday's ain't the same without teen wolf.
@leboism @DeadshirtDotNet foolish mortal, I have sat through TEEN WOLF *and* TEEN WOLF TOO, nothing you can do can harm me anymore.
Oh just realized that there was no teen wolf today :((((((((( MAJOR MISSING :(((( January'16. &lt;&lt; SO LONGGGGG.

It's already Friday. Not the TGIF kind of Friday... Can time freeze for a while?.
And I don't know about TGIF. Fridays are terrible. I'm more of a TGIS person. Can it be Saturday already?.
Everyone's like TGIF!  And I'm over here like I work tonight. And a double tomorrow. And Sunday. And monday.  #grindin #needmoney.
...and TGIF!!! What a week... I really dislike the 1st and the 3rd..
Yesterday was lastweek,and TGIF was two days ago,which was also last week, so how the hell is tomorrow monday?.
this bitch said "TGIF" and it's Monday....
TGIF is totally meaningless when you have to work on Saturday..just sayin;)#PSYBringItOn.
@thorharris666 or "happy Monday" or "TGIF" or... How about we all just shut the fuck up for a bit? The animals will appreciate it..
I prefer TGIS than TGIF now. Cause friday is always a stressful day.
@GCTigerTracker - ONCE AGAIN TIGER WOODS SHITS THE DAMN BED ON A  SATURDAY, SUNDAY OR BOTH (which BOTH is what it is most of the time).
Tiger Woods is the biggest tease of the entire weekend. In contention and blows it on Sunday. Next step play 72 holes instead of 54..
I'm here watching golf hoping Tiger Woods can do well and this ass hole Triple bogey the 11th hole!!!.

Former world No 1 Tiger Woods blamed his putting after struggling to an opening round score of 75 in the US PGA Championship on Thursday.
@Buccigross and it just makes Tiger Woods look even worse than he may be..
Serena has been twice as dominant as Tiger Woods ever was in his prime and she gets 1/10th of the accolades and adulation.
@777Mediaprod Why is it because the flies are Tom Cruise from edge of tomorrow. Try to do something die, restart..
Why does Tom Cruise take 10,000 times to figure things out in the movie Edge Of Tomorrow, but gets it right 1st time in Mission Impossible?.
I would have enjoyed Edge of Tomorrow more if Tom Cruise had to start each day by re-spawning in the bathroom of a Bubba Gump Shrimp..
@gregthepaladin @padgettish @bootaide I mean it's 5th in a series, I don't expect perfection from that or Tom cruise just good action.
@pecunium Edge of Tomorrow was Yet Another Tom Cruise Movie, which is to say it was too long, blew up too much shit, &amp; needed a better end..
From The Guardian: Benjamin Lee, 'Paul Haggis: "shame on" press for not asking Tom Cruise about Scientology' http://t.co/Ny1rWmhqMR.

@steve_hanke Tsipras is currently on holidays and on the 6th he is going to Egypt. So i dont think he realizes the situation we are in.
Tsipras - "talks are in final stretch"  which is Greek for "talks are about to break down and I may call a referendum any minute now".
No big deal, Tsipras reminds his admirers all over the world.  If possible, a 2nd emasculation won't be opposed by him..
@BritainFirst It's like Tsipras says, they're in the middle of a humanitarian crisis. BF should have their march cancelled, and the money.
@Hugodixon "more moderate" may be! But plenty of uneducated demagogs, who have not done a day's work....Starting  with Tsipras, himself!.

@paulwaugh to be fair Paul, after SNP, UKIP, Boundary changes &amp; 50 fewer MPs, it may not be leader that's influencing the 80% who disagree.
@BaronGraham I understand why people may support them, but I totally despise UKIP. They're racist bigoted beasts, nothing average about that.
The same ppl who voted UKIP in May are only defending migrants coming to the UK because it seems like the 'conscientious' or 'right' answer..
If there were an election tomorrow,UKIP still wouldnt get a great number of MP's,I hate to say it but I think this country is about finished.

Serato DJ isn't compatible with Windows 10 yet :( ...got to spin on my old laptop Saturday..
Just spent 5 hours babysitting my 5th attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 without success. Not sure what's wrong, but it's getting ridiculous..
anyone having problems with Windows 10? may be coincidental but since i downloaded, my WiFi keeps dropping out. Itunes had a malfunction.
@AllAllen7 If the issue only occurs with Windows 10 and not your other PC or device. It sounds like the issue may be with Windows 10..
Upgrading to Windows 10. Might not be recording tonight after all. May need to cancel tomorrow night's stream to record Fable..
My AD/DA interface drivers just went BOOM!  It seems Microsoft is forcing me to upgrade to Windows 10. I may gone some time....
@squeejay this is on Windows 10, may have something to do with it; everything else is also slower than sh** through a funnel since 'upgrade'.
Microsoft needs to get their shit together. Xbox live just went down for a 2nd day, what a fucking surprise @XboxSupport  #xboxlive.
@XboxSupport abt time we got a reply from xbox 4 hours and counting, this is the 3rd time in a month what u doing to fix this issue xbox.
@thepieface I hate it more. My Xbox controller is in London so I can't play until sunday.
@MrTLexify my Xbox box live expired last Friday the struggle are real.
Just sitting here staring at my Xbox waiting for the #Destiny update to finish downloading. 30 + minutes. I may die waiting....
What will the Destiny 2.0 patch be at when I get home? 70% 48%? 95%? 2%? Who knows. My Xbox may just be on fire the way things were going..
@BungieHelp I've sat here since 7 its now 1am and it has moved 2% i'm off if it's not done when I wake I'll be ringing xbox for a refund..
@KonamiSupport yo wtf why can't you fix the severs on Xbox one for fob it's September 9th and again can't get on.
This may be our last chance to see Zlatan in the World Cup and FIFA totally fucked it up. Shocker..
Friend with connections just offered to let me meet Zlatan &amp; Co. in NJ tomorrow. Alas, my body sucks and I cannot..
So, about Zlatan... I don't want him. All reports are that he's not a good teammate. He'd be our 3rd DP Fwd, how do you work the 3 together?.
@OccupyBears he fancied rolling the ball to Zlatan on the edge of the box early on and then he totally fucked up for PSG's 1st goal....
fucking cunt. I hope he eats Zlatan's shit in retirement league. https://t.co/blH85NzExz.
@MinoRaiola just because your hunger for more money Zlatan will play in a team that finished at the 10th place and struggle for top 5,shame.
Watching a replay of the PSG / Lille match from Friday. No Zlatan makes PSG unwatchable..
@ACMilanNorway anyway, telling Zlatan he'll be the center of the team is like telling the sun it's the center of the solar system. No crap..
The top 4 strikers in the world are not for sale and our coach can't handle the 5th (Zlatan).
Today United should have done better, the referee didn't help at all!!!!  Rooney to 10 pls! Just sign Zlatan tomorrow pleeeeeeze.
If there is a silver lining this shows LVG if we dont buy anyone b4 Tuesday we is fucked!! Fuck it i would take Zlatan!!.
