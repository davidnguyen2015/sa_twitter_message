Murray has given it his all, which wasn't expected after the last few days he has had but Federer just unbreakable. TB 2nd set. #CincyTennis.
Federer stays winning. Into the finals tomorrow..
Federer beats Murray 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach #CincyTennis final. He'll be going for his 7th title vs Novak Djokovic, who is going for his first.
Way to go Roger. Old man Federer just keeps rolling along. #Djokernole v. #Fed for the final tomorrow. #CincyTennis.
Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow. Fancy the Swiss, can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one..
Federer will play another final tomorrow. This guy is just amazing. #CincyTennis.
Excited for the Federer vs. Djokovic final in Cincinnati tomorrow afternoon. Should be some great tennis!.
Serena punches her ticket to the finals in straight sets. Joins Djokovic and Federer in tomorrow's #CincyTennis singles finals. Decent trio..
Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them..
Federer breaks early in the 2nd set! Even consolidates the break! Up 3-0! #RF #Tennis #CincyTennis.
Tiger, Federer, Serena, the Niners (eesh about those guys), and some cold TX brews. laaazzzy birthday Sunday..
For the 1st time, Federer has beaten No.1 and No.2 players in the ATP Rankings in consecutive matches en route to a title. #CincyTennis.
Federer is my 2nd fave male tennis player of all time right after the great Arthur Ashe..
What a great day for world sport: Usain got his 9th gold, Federer claimed Cincinnati Title no 7 and I pumped some weights. #truepro.
New @TennisPodcast tomorrow, reviewing Federer, Serena and the pre US Open storylines. This is what we sound like https://t.co/2x0O2UDCe8.
Add to the results, Federer over Djokovic  and Lewis Hamilton, and it's not a bad Sunday at all!.
23rd of August was such a nice day, England lift Ashes, Bolt won 100 m and Federer beats Djokovic in Cincinati..
Papa you need a hat thus said one of Federer's twin girls.......congrats again for winning Cinci for the 7th time @rogerfederer.
Federer overtakes Lendl for second longest streak of being seeded at the US Open in the Open Era. 15th straight year. Connors leads with 18..
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray.
All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen.
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!.
Federer is looking good after winning Cincy for the 7th time..

How to watch Federer and Murray on Tuesday at the 2015 US Open: Roger Federer will begin his 2015 US Open on T... http://t.co/GlxQkdiJZN.
@Jim_Hulbert Federer faced the highest ranked guy in R1. His draw is tricky. So is Murray's.If Fed reaches the QFs, then he may meet Berdy..
I'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch Federer's game tomorrow!.
Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves.
Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss..
Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading..
Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs. Tomic match takes!.
Jo Konta's win over Muguruza was the longest ever Women's #USOpen match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as Federer's entire match! Woah!.
Federer defeats Darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd Round at the @usopen accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd Round.
Last year, majority of the Federer matches took place primetime.  This year, it's the other way around.  2nd on Ashe tomorrow.
The 1st week of the 2015 #USOpen is almost up &amp; the big names of Serena, Venus, Djokovic, Murray, Federer &amp; Wawrinka are still in the draw..
@mmunro91 I may have never seen a player play a higher tennis level than I just saw, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic included. Make no mistake,.
Fognini is I believe only the 3rd one to beat Nadal 3 or more times in a year - the others (no points for guessing) Federer and Djokovic..
Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve!! Federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen.
Good starts for Federer and Stosur. Berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!.
Wow, tragic start from Federer in the 3rd.
Just like in the 2nd, Federer breaks back..
Roger while having trouble with serve, he is still through to 4th round! Federer might face Isner in 4th round.
@JohnIsner I concur with your coach. Its you! #AmexTennis Good luck tomorrow against Federer!.
Federer defeats Kohlschreiber 6-3 6-4 6-4 to go through to the 4th Round @usopen.
Federer advances into fourth round at US Open: In the blazing New York sun, Federer seems to be in his element... http://t.co/CoiDuhKlL4.
@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep...! Yep, Murray and Federer into the top 16. Phew! :) See you tomorrow!.
Monday at the US Open: Murray, Federer &amp; Konta are all in action at Flushing Meadows today http://t.co/50ZM0cOEjT http://t.co/YlLS4kf0of.
Federer's second serve placement is awesome. That's why he's the best server ever. Nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve.
Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015.
Federer saved 4 BP (from 0/40) and holds for 2-2 in the 2nd set..
Ok time to check back in with tennis - Isner and Federer heading into a 2nd tiebreak.
Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots..
Federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. Leads Isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) #usopen.
I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?".
I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015.
That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el.
Wow, Federer wastes 3 bps with 3 Isner's 2nd serves. Fed 0/8 on bps tonight.
Federer's 1st serve is just...perfect. #USOpen.
Federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve... Lol wow.
@NerdistMom It's weird that in the 1st set Federer &amp; Isner went game for game until the tiebreak. Then Federer trucked him in the tiebreak.
Federer breaks his own record with a 14th appearance at the ATP Finals after reaching the US QF #FinalShowdown http://t.co/ugI3PQBp8w.
With his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure Federer will crush Gasquet in the QF. C'mon Federer!! http://t.co/LHCEhZo26g.

Old radio commercials for Grateful Dead albums may just be the best thing I've discovered.
Hannibal has been the most amazing show on NBC. I really hope they get a 4th season. Bryan Fuller is amazing #Hannibal #HannibalFinale.
At the ending, there're oysters on Hannibal's table. How considerate Hannibal is ...but c'mon Will needs fishes #Hannibal #HannibalMicDrop.
ok when I'm sober tomorrow I NEED to talk to people about Hannibal.
@afooltocry @HorrorHoneys It's my uneducated opinion that Breaking Bad is the best show in the history of time.Hannibal might now be the 2nd.
@neoprod @GillianA @NBCHannibal well you can't do this all by yourself ... Hannibal is inviting to Dinner and Will may finally accepting him.
Hannibal finale on Wednesday in the UK. Time to catch up on all the episodes I missed while on holiday..
Tomorrow I will start catching up on Hannibal. I got to ep2 of S3 and had to stop because I wasn't ready for what a ride it was gonna be..
We're deep in Season 3 of HANNIBAL and Will Graham may have met his match with The Tooth Fairy http://t.co/aHbA8EnCJG http://t.co/fJP8d00hgs.
@theofficialmads may I say sir your portrayal of Hannibal is beautiful and haunting. Hope you get this message. Look forward to ur next work.
I may have a massive love-hate relationship with Hannibal but Bryan Fuller's heart has always been in the right place..
I'm going to be so tired tomorrow but all I want to do is reblog Hannibal related stuff on tumblr. *cries* #Hannibal.
Binge watched Hannibal all night and I may have just checked under my bed for a killer. #adultlife.
@wylerette it may be called Hannibal but the show does revolve around the both of them plus bryan said they are meant to stay together.
We've got to wait until Wednesday night here in the UK for the Hannibal finale yet I've pretty much seen it all in gif form.
Tweet from the great state of Denial. New tv show called #Hannibal on thur at 10pm. The guy plyn Hannibal has good cheek bones. Im intrigued.
Tonights a good stopping point. Tomorrow I watch the last 6 episodes of Hannibal, ie. the Red Dragon arc..
I loved the Hannibal finale Saturday. It was good enough and open enough to interpretation to please all types of Fannibal. #HannibalMicDrop.
@amalalllama it's a lot bigger than you may think just take a look at Hannibal.
The moment I truly fell in love with Will was at the beginning of Sakizuke, when he plays Hannibal for the 1st time. #Hannibal #rewatch.
HS Softball: Hannibal 5 Moberly 6. Going into the bottom of the 7th. #HannibalLadyPirates.
Jack Baumann scores again with 36 minutes left in the 2nd half to make it 2-1 Hannibal over Kirksville..
I dream of a world where not only is Hannibal in it 4th season but we're also looking forward to a Hannibal vs Dexter Halloween special lol.
Nashville, Hannibal, &amp; Empire, I may've named you after TV that was popular at the time of your conception, but you are still my triplets!.
@ReadyP2 I'll send you a pic tomorrow. It's out in the garage and I'm far too comfy in my slippers watching finale of Hannibal ;).
Gutted that Hannibal has finished,really hope someone pics it up for Fuller to do a 4th season or even a movie,sure @pashley13 would agree.
@DrHLecterMD @lecters_imago / You portray Hannibal beautifully may I just say..
@Amirabiabdallah Dexter is great but give Hannibal another try, it gets better after the 5th episode :p.
@filmgrabber Michael Marshall shot the hell out of the Hannibal finale. (This movie rules. Loving Maddin Monday).
OK so maybe I'm watching, for the 1st time, the 1st episode of the 1st season of Hannibal and OH MY LORD WHAT IS THIS.
@LowriBearman Thank you my love! And I have had a fab day! Distinct lack of Hannibal but I'll put that right tomorrow! xx.
I'll be sending off Summer and HANNIBAL tomorrow. It'll be a bittersweet day..
@JohnC1908 I pretty sure none of those fans regret not being there to see Harper strike out in the 9th on a pitch in the dirt..

Big spot for Harper now in the 7th to impress the fans left in the park.

OK, last chance for the #Nats. It's Werth, Rendon, Harper vs. Familia in 9th, down 8-7..
Werth, Rendon, and Harper due up in the bottom of the 9th, #Nats trail Mets 8-7..
I hope all the fans stayed into the 9th to watch Harper go 0-5. #nats.
#Nats Rendon bunts but Werth is erased at 2nd. Runner on 1st with 1 out.  Harper at bat....
@KoryCPC telling why you should trust Harper. Worth the 10 min. to listen. Not after eating, though.#cdnpoli http://t.co/zG540pZvIU #cdnpoli.
@SouthpawSlinger @jonmorosi @FOXSports @FS1 But he's certainly been the 1st or 2nd best player in the NL overall, Harper and Kershaw better..
@RedPorchReport Harper putting up historic numbers. Thus far it's been a series to forget at the plate, but, again, he didn't pitch the 7th..
@EvanLSolomon Harper gets first chance, most seats won get 2nd chance. Easy. Harper does not play well with others, ask Danny Williams..
@ian_wayne @P_Wog   Keep focus on Harper&amp; all these good things will be added unto you May the best man who wins the heart of Canadians.

I should be getting into bed, I am however instead looking through my iPod for songs I might want to pole to.  I may be addicted..
Let you know what kind of day it's going to be--1st song up on my IPod is "Do It Now". By Mos Def/YB.  Leggo!.
Still head over heels in love with my (4th generation) iPod. Curated to the hilt. #ipod #Apple #oldtech #personalmediadevices.
BTW, @LeeIngram4 is the guy who gave me an iPod last year, on which my son (@PChangerP ) 1st set me up on Twitter. My 1st tweet was 9/6/14..
off on holiday tomorrow, downloading apps for ipod for the plane anyone know any good free ones?.
@normwood I still have my original newfangled iPod. Maybe I'll bring it to the game on Monday..
Hey @UKRunChat please RT, running GNR on Sunday, anyone got suggestions for good running songs.  Need to update the iPod..
Finally gonna buy my own camera tomorrow ! I'm so excited, I'll be able to take pictures with something else than my old ipod..
Don't forget to collect the bills and win free ipod nano 7th generation &amp; 17% CK vouchers of total bills , we... http://t.co/CNn4Ln9swy.
Sitting in my office, window open, sun shining in, listening to my ipod, wondering exactly what the catch is with this job..
1 gud thing about losing my phone is that it made me use my iPod which has all the songs I used listen to in 3rd year.
I drenched the old iPod nano (6th gen) in isopropanol and it actually worked! The screen will never look the same but totally worth it..
Found my old iPod from like 7th grade and am now realizing I listened to some hood tunes for just a kid!!.
I'm not taking my iPod to school tomorrow because I want to have a battery when I go to my concert.
@amitbhawani @geekyranjit  ...what are your thoughts about Apple's iPod touch 6th gen?.
@jroberts332 @jobot935 [2/2] That's why my Prog/Indie/Heavy Rock-filled iPod has One Direction's 3rd and 4th albums on it. I am Not kidding..
I used to absolutely love the music to Silent Hill. Even had it on my ipod! https://t.co/2UZ23Nn4kX.
i went through my old iPod nano and I still listen to the same music I did in 5th grade..chili peppers, green day, the killers, blink omfg.
Found an ancient ipod nano, I may have to keep it..
Gonna try to run 6 laps tomorrow atleast 5 it should be easy I just can't talk to ppl. Just gotta listen to my iPod and keep runnin.
1st song on the iPod upon leaving GB is 'Good Life' by One Republic &amp; upon leaving an amazing weekend w/ @Amy__Bailey &amp; her fam it truly is!.
@TayToOoCute miss you tay! I was just looking thru my ipod &amp; I have vids of you singing back in SAT prep lol.
I have loads to tell you guys that will make yall super proud but I'm using my iPod now and it's super laggy so I'll tell later or tomorrow.
#FF @innocent - not just for the drinks but for Jay-Z's 99 problems! 99 problems that we may just ponder about at some point in our lives!.
Sitting at a curb staring at the White House Listening to jay-z.thats a fine Friday.
For those who may not know, Jay-Z wrote the verses for Still D.R.E but he's never disrespected Dre or ever spoken about ghostwriting..
December 4th only cause I used the beginning in my Jay-Z speech for class https://t.co/5bw2R2xGvo.
Was hoping this would escalate to be something like Nas vs Jay-Z but Meek got KO'ed in the 2nd round lol.
[#NEW] Video: Casey Veggies Talks First Meeting With Jay-Z At 17 Years Old, Working Hard to Inspire the Youth http://t.co/3ETpyD7C9o Dec 15,.
Meek drooped like a Jay-z album the 2nd &amp; 3rd time you hear it. You will understand it and Fall in love with it.
Roadblock: In the immortal words of Jay-Z: "Whatever deity may guide my life, dear lord don't let me die tonight.... http://t.co/mnDysX2NKb.
CRAZY IN LOVE by BEYONCE FEAT. JAY-Z was no.2 in the UK charts on 2 August 2003 https://t.co/rnU7AFDvUY.
My following may not be as big as Jay-Z's but I got a solid supportive growing following. Thanks for the love. #TeamM00Y0U.
the 1st dance at my wedding will actually just be a duet of Diamonds From Sierra Leone-Remix with my husband as Jay-Z and myself as Kanye..
Aye now Meek may surprise us. You know when Jay-Z dropped Takeover they thought it was over for Nas. And then Ether.......
May the best of your today be the worse off your tomorrow - Jay-Z.
#WEHO: @ChrisPipkinSC is leading the pack for a THE CARTERS: Lil Wayne, Beyonce, and Jay-Z ride Thursday at 5:30pm! Grab a bike!.
Imagine if Ether had dropped in the social media age. We may not have the same respect we do for Jay-z today..
I know it's old, but The Beatles, Jay-Z, Danger Mouse -- c'mon... Classic mix --... http://t.co/Q0ZwccX6Vi.
I grew up to this song..didn't knew the 2nd verse is about beyonce..until now.JAY-Z - Lost One ft. Chrisette Michele http://t.co/LYgSbix0Wp.
The sun, earth, the Lakers, Jay-Z, Oprah, and 5 whoppers https://t.co/YxJH6KayOw.
Prince confirmed that he and Jay-Z will release an album September 7. #PaisleyPark  #Minneapolis.
St James Park randomly playing the instrumental for My 1st Song by Jay-Z at half time?  Decent..
Talib, Jay-Z, Kanye, T.I, Big Pooh, Dela, J Dilla, Nas, Pete Rock, 9th Wonder and the legendary Slum Village..
Personally handing Jay-Z jerseys may be the highlight of my New York existence. First time I've been star struck..
Jay-Z and Beyonce came to Taylor's 25th but not Kim and Kanye's wedding. Imma let Taylor finish, but she had the best birthday of all time..
#FridayFun! Jay-Z's got that Friday feeling - http://t.co/2uGbXgEASI  Have you?.
Who Belong In the 3rd spot for top 3 of all time. Jay-Z, Nas or Eminem?.
Enjoying how the Jay-Z vs. Abdel Halim Hafez lawsuit forces serious newspapers to put "Big Pimpin'" in headlines. http://t.co/WCBHI8g4ws.
When you realize classes start the 9th so the AC/DC concert will be the best concert since Eminem and Jay-Z #thatwasgoat.
Sept 11, 2001-  Good: Jay-Z drops the best rap album of the decade (The Blueprint)  Bad: World Trade Center gets destroyed   #MindBlown.
Dreamed I was @Beyonce and I spent the night making out with Jay-Z at a Lower East Side rooftop party until the sun came up..
My nigga @Lightshow10thPL sat down with Jay-Z's right hand man on a rooftop in the city. I'm rootin' for youngin'. Straight up!.
The best part of living in New York is the nightlife. The 2nd best part is knowing that Jay-Z and Beyonce share the same weather as me..
@SeaGlass4Nicole Today was a Jay-Z type of the day. Who knows what tomorrow will bring?.
@JKailli Although you may know this better than I do since you're from California lol I'm not knocking Jay-Z view in black culture, I say.
We make a million of beats, cause our stories is deep. And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet. - Jay-Z.
Only looking forward to Kanye's performance at the VMA's tomorrow! Heard he's bringing out Rih, Bey, Jay-z &amp; Paul McCarthy.
I was certainly not expecting @JColeNC to bring @Drake and Jay-Z to the Ville.  I may have dropped a tear or two.  Greatest show ever!.
If Kanye became President, folk that wrote off the masonic/illuminati symbols in he and Jay-Z's music/vids as meaningless, may think again!.
Also the correct Top 5 is Eminem, Jay-Z, 2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G., and Ice Cube in that order with Big Pun as the 6th man.
I knew Jay-z was getting old but I forgot about Eminem. He looks 30 something! https://t.co/fFCMZvL6l9.
@MsTosciMarie Not really and I'm a huge Jay-Z fan. But, when March 9th come around? Biggie all day everyday.
The game 1st album 1 song he say he rap like Eazy-E then Nas then 50 cent then dr Dre then Jay-Z then Eazy-E again then like his dead bro.
May the Lord give you Jay-Z and Beyonce's kinda love... No way that relationship is fake or for social media.
The day Jay-z comes to S.A I'll be the 1st person to cue  at the computicket  I love that man.

Javier Saviola: "I'd be delighted if Messi won his 5th Ballon d'Or because of the quality of his football and because of our friendship.".
Messi has ALWAYS scored in the 1st or 2nd leg of the CL Round of 16 since the 2007/08 season: 2 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 6 - 2 - 1 (ongoing).
What a great cover for the 1986 winner....I feel @francefootball need to do something very special for Messi's 5th. http://t.co/ixSDV38UhN.
Messi and Ronaldo both go up a rating in FUT 16 with Messi a 94 and Ronaldo 93 Suarez is a 90 as 3rd best player in the game..
Hahah Lol so Halilovic was shaking when he saw Messi for the 1st time. I'ld probably faint if i ever meet him..
3-0 Lavezzi on fire w his 2nd goal. Too bad he couldn't do it in World Cup or Copa America. Crowd still chanting "Messi" #Argentina #Bolivia.
66' GOAL!!! #Argentina  Messi with a header makes it the 5th of the game  #Argentina 5-0 #Bolivia.
Whoaaaa...! #MESSI's show is on.. MESSI with the 2nd Goal... MESSI scored a brace. The greatest ever has destroyed them. #ARGvBOL.
@SivanJohn LOL the finishing was quite similar to Messi's 2nd goal against Bayern..
@LeslieeAndradee Messi scored with his 4th touch like omg! Like it's not fair..
James Rodriguez is fast closing in on the 2nd grade of best footballers (those immediately after Messi and Ronaldo)....
The 3rd goal scorer of Mauritania just became Messi right there passing five defenders....aowa Bafana Bafana.
@Safeeyar yap. That's why i dont understand why they're making fun with messi's height. Do they expecting him to be a Jan Koller? Lol.
Iniesta is the 3rd best after Messi and Ronaldo, no one comes close, not Neymar not Hazard #spain.
Imagine having a 20th of Messi's ability. You'd be the best in your team.
I told my dad I'm going to see messi on Tuesday , and he called me a bastard cuz he can't go.
Messi was just 20 years &amp; 161 days old when he secured a podium finish (3rd place) at the 2007 Ballon d'Or ceremony http://t.co/wwtDG2aWjb.
Nice to be in the @guardian_sport YouTube round up. Mine is the last link - Messi is the headline. Surely a mix-up?! http://t.co/KheYatUISH.
@ultrasuristic Thank you Kluivert. These days a lot of people make Ronaldo look like a Sunday League player when compared to Messi.....
Messi (back in January): 'My dream is to finish my career at Barcelona for as long as people want me'.
Initial pass to Messi zipped in. Only he could tame the ball &amp; pass to Xavi 1st time. Minimal backlift from another planet. @Phase_in_out.
I may not have gotten a picture of Messi, but I still saw him with my own eyes! Fuck what everyone else says lol.
@CulesAmericano Messi has the 6th best dribble succes rate (81%) in Europe's top 5 leagues this term of players to attempt 10+ dribbles.
@HoldTheMilan: Alciato: Bee will invest 150 million in January, another 200 in the Summer and plans to bring Messi by 2017.

Have uni tomorrow morning but need to say bae Messi tonight. its my drug..
Going to see Messi the magician play in November! #Campnou https://t.co/gl1iY9XZ7f.
And people still doubt @WayneRooney  absolutely comical. He may not be Ronaldo and Messi but he's our best player by a mile.
Messi will now attempt to break Telmo Zarra's record on 22 November when Barcelona face Sevilla at the Camp Nou.
@Badandy538_ At the end of the day,  we're talking about great players so any argument against may sound like nitpicking. Messi is GOAT tho..
Messi may be the best player in the world but Chicharito is the best player in the universe #ChichaDios @CH14_ http://t.co/BbPKl2CfGj.
he was level ffs! also, he may be a problem child but no Argentine forward links with Messi better than Tevez..
the crowds gonna go crazy when Messi comes in for the 2nd half.
Okay, I can see how you may not like lebron or Tom Brady but not Messi..this guy has nations on his back..
12:26am and we've got US Open Drama, Colbert's debut, and Messi just scored a sick goal for Argentina.  All Live/1st run now..
And that is why messi is the best in the world. Good game though. Now to wait till October 10..
And Argentina say Messi does nothing for the national team??! That goal was just magical Messi time as usual, c'mon! XD.
Messi has registered back-to-back hat-tricks (3+ goals) for Barcelona for the 3rd time in his career.
But Messi made the former premier league champions look like a group of 11 lads at goals  https://t.co/fAPDWwbX0d.

That was one of the best Monday Night Raw shows I've seen in a while, finishing off with Sting! Could we see #RollinsvsSting.
Including his TNA title wins, Sting is a 14-time World Champion. Beating Seth would tie him with Cena for 2nd of all time. @wwe #raw.
great RAW tonight...1st the Dudley Boys and then to end with Sting!!!   #WWERaw #WWE.
Sting winning at #NightOfChampions results in either Sting vs Taker at Mania or Sting vs Cena and I've got a bad feeling it's the 2nd option.
Sting is back, and the Dudleys return :D Quite an eventful Monday Night Raw on the whole. Lesnar-Dallas though X'D #RawBrooklyn.
@ryan24672 @CMPuLs3 And it'd work, Seth getting the rub and being Sting's 2nd ever opponent + a month long reign with both titles is BIG.
@Chrissie32NY so tomorrow we should try &amp; plan a trip to see the next PPV as Sting might be world champ!!.
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/zDth0kovNW Seth Rollins vs Sting the Returns 2015 WWE Raw, Aug 24.

Sometimes I realise I know all the words to movies. And that those movies mostly have Tom Cruise in them. I may have had a thing for him..
Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation: I really tried, you guys, but I can only like Tom Cruise once per decade and Edge of Tomorrow was SO GOOD..
may i just say that Tom Cruise looks hot as fuck in a navy blue suit.
Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise is another bad ass movie; I have never seen it till now..
Can't wait for The Edge of the Day After Tomorrow, where Tom Cruise gets cold over and over again until he brings down the oil companies..
@LoriJulia what is that book that is supposedly about Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise? I'm going to Barnes&amp; Noble tomorrow! #help.
Edge of Tomorrow is my new favourite.  Tom Cruise , man you are so cute !.
I'm not huge fan of Tom Cruise but much like the last movie I saw him in, Edge of Tomorrow, #MissionImpossibleRogueNation was really good..
@nuahs6881 You mean Edge of Tomorrow? It is surprisingly wonderful and I wound up feeling about Tom Cruise the way I did as a kid after.
Happy Bank Holiday Monday ! It's raining in the UK so I'm off to the movies later to perv on Tom Cruise lol... http://t.co/Thbz2qc7Rv.

@WhiteHartYid bit like Edge of Tomorrow film, but in that Tom Cruise gets it right in the end unlike Spurs.
Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise is phenomenal.

Theresa May is laying down a marker for the Tory leadership. Tough on immigration and tough on the causes of immigration..
Mrs May doesn't mean it but just wants to be elected Tory leader when Dave steps down Then it will be all smiles @DSORennie @edwardlucas.
@pperrin @nellesapelle Very wise. Hard to see UKIP going any further tho. Lab &amp; Tory split may open up new space like you said..
Tory saw me with my physics textbook and she said "I wish you the best of luck may God be with you" y me hecho la bendicion.
Tory concerned about carding black kids and the traffic on the Gardiner.He'll speak to the press Wednesday about the Gardiner..
@AllenStarr1 @TrippyPip I'm a Tory voter. I agree with austerity. We are the 5th biggest economy in the world, we can afford to help.

Tory in Wallingford on the 19th!!! Might have to swing thru!!!.
not a bit ashamed to say I have preplanned LOTS of jokes about the Queen/parasitology to troll my Tory royalist classmates tomorrow.

Roll on Saturday and beyond ! Looking forward to an opposition Leader to REALLY fight the eternal enemy-THE TORY ! #Corbyn4Leader.
Trump is having a anti-deal rally at the capital tomorrow? Might have to pop by after some meetings tomorrow.

@Hugodixon I would say Oct are early elections. If Tsipras doesn't hold them then, he will go the way of PASOK &amp; Samaras when held later..
@IrateGreek Correct! When 3rd memo voted and starts bighting in Tsipras likely to go the way of Pasok &amp; ND. Euro? 63% say don't fear drachma.
This man made up my mind to oppose #Brexit when he told Tsipras to hold his head high #betteroffin https://t.co/G4TFuxOMeM.

Tsipras says that the September 20 elections will provide his party a strong mandate to form a majority government. http://t.co/pWzd4KhDmj.
Good (Greek) editorial/primer about upcoming Greek elections as polls show Tsipras on back foot http://t.co/Yy1HdH2DMc.
What a difference exactly two months can make. Tsipras faces crowds on 4 July v 4 Sep http://t.co/KZLMWiW9Qd.
@Reuters and Fofi Gennimata of Pasok,  as the recent poll also explicitly show, ND may be getting more popularity than Tsipras led Syriza..
