@kewldoode72 Will be interesting to see if  Sony addresses the heat issues in the Z5 - it may have found a work around.
@bollybrit @itsnacool both of webb ones made less money than the 3rd Raimi one, plus the success of Marvel had Sony scared i think.
And in comes Sony with the letdown. Only one color. Clap it up... low and slow https://t.co/6jaRCgfvTP.
Exactly why I'll never buy Sony. Those 1st class ass kissers are dick pulling the media for high scores on future games. LOL. @tomwarren.
@The_CrapGamer Sony don't care about their exclusives they never made a theme console for their exclusives https://t.co/ft9VpAxSjs.
I got no love for Sony. They can disappear tomorrow,someone else would just replace them and try harder for consumers. @Gaming_forever1.
@strunk_daddy For any info you would need to contact Sony. Apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused ^AI.
Still waiting for my phone to come back from Sony..bit lost without it. Hopefully back up by Thursday. Last upload was from my PC..
PSN is down for some users, not all. No prior warning from Sony either - can you sign in right now? RT. http://t.co/1mi6lwVfAR.
@WithYouRebelX I've had problems with my email and haven't received any information for Saturday's Star Wars secret cinema. Can you resend?.
#ForceFriday as a whole was pretty disappointing. Not sure who dropped the ball - retailers, Hasbro, or Disney. It's Star Wars! C'mon!.
@alexkidwell I give zero shits about Star Wars, and I'm only mildly excited by Bond films. Will I be seeing you on RHAP tomorrow?!.
@BitterOldJoe it gave the impression the whole thing is a beery deconstruction of Star Wars for adult edgelords. I may read it anyway.
One issue I had with the Sting stuff, But it also supporting one of my theories during Mania... http://t.co/Kxr2yb69ze #RAW.
C'mon, Vince...we're not stupid.  We all know Sting's going to job to Rollins to make him look strong..
Guy at T-mobile: ok so just call the store tomorrow and ask for me so we can set up the phone! Me the next day: what the fuck was his name..
Google Support says compatible with T-Mobile, so...guess we bug them for a new SIM tomorrow, as planned..
@greetmytweet_ hahah I haven't had one since Monday, and it was supposed to be expedited here. T-Mobile is a joke..
For $80 on T-Mobile U get unlimited talk/text/data while in the US/Mexico/Canada. C'mon get with the times #canadiancellphoneplanssuck.
I like T-Mobile but this upgrade having spazzed is making me uneasy. I'll ride it out for now, but another incident may make me switch..
