@Just_nne2605 did the team score goals? Did they beat City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Draw Chelsea ? How about that for sneaking into 4th.
@JHickin it doesn't matter where they play, what matters is they play for Wales, better than England, may I add! (P.s, Ramsey is Arsenal).
Take Welbeck being unable for the Euros with a pinch of salt. Pretty sure we'll see him in an Arsenal shirt come May..
Thoughts turning to sat &amp; whilst there's obvious concerns if we get at them early as we did at arsenal with a high tempo we can win #LFC.
Arsenal will have no trouble finishing 4th and above. We've done it with Chamakh-Bendtner upfront..

Murray has given it his all, which wasn't expected after the last few days he has had but Federer just unbreakable. TB 2nd set. #CincyTennis.
Federer stays winning. Into the finals tomorrow..
Federer beats Murray 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach #CincyTennis final. He'll be going for his 7th title vs Novak Djokovic, who is going for his first.
Way to go Roger. Old man Federer just keeps rolling along. #Djokernole v. #Fed for the final tomorrow. #CincyTennis.
Djokovic v Federer should be good one tomorrow. Fancy the Swiss, can't see Djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one..
Federer will play another final tomorrow. This guy is just amazing. #CincyTennis.
Excited for the Federer vs. Djokovic final in Cincinnati tomorrow afternoon. Should be some great tennis!.
Serena punches her ticket to the finals in straight sets. Joins Djokovic and Federer in tomorrow's #CincyTennis singles finals. Decent trio..
Some outrageous shots from Federer in the tiebreak. The clean half volley return of a Djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them..
Federer breaks early in the 2nd set! Even consolidates the break! Up 3-0! #RF #Tennis #CincyTennis.
Tiger, Federer, Serena, the Niners (eesh about those guys), and some cold TX brews. laaazzzy birthday Sunday..
For the 1st time, Federer has beaten No.1 and No.2 players in the ATP Rankings in consecutive matches en route to a title. #CincyTennis.
Federer is my 2nd fave male tennis player of all time right after the great Arthur Ashe..
What a great day for world sport: Usain got his 9th gold, Federer claimed Cincinnati Title no 7 and I pumped some weights. #truepro.
New @TennisPodcast tomorrow, reviewing Federer, Serena and the pre US Open storylines. This is what we sound like https://t.co/2x0O2UDCe8.
Add to the results, Federer over Djokovic  and Lewis Hamilton, and it's not a bad Sunday at all!.
23rd of August was such a nice day, England lift Ashes, Bolt won 100 m and Federer beats Djokovic in Cincinati..
Papa you need a hat thus said one of Federer's twin girls.......congrats again for winning Cinci for the 7th time @rogerfederer.
Federer overtakes Lendl for second longest streak of being seeded at the US Open in the Open Era. 15th straight year. Connors leads with 18..
@ViVi_RFObsessed Looks clear cut for Federer though. But 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against Stan or Murray.
All though Federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter I think Gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen.
@livetennis I believe Federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!.
Federer is looking good after winning Cincy for the 7th time..

@Jim_Hulbert Federer faced the highest ranked guy in R1. His draw is tricky. So is Murray's.If Fed reaches the QFs, then he may meet Berdy..
I'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch Federer's game tomorrow!.
Yes, Federer's attacking return is brilliant.  But yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves.
Not going to be able to watch Federer's match vs Darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the Swiss..
Darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. Well, one kind of bleeding because Federer's still leading..
Federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the Hewitt vs. Tomic match takes!.
Jo Konta's win over Muguruza was the longest ever Women's #USOpen match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as Federer's entire match! Woah!.
Federer defeats Darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd Round at the @usopen accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd Round.
Last year, majority of the Federer matches took place primetime.  This year, it's the other way around.  2nd on Ashe tomorrow.
The 1st week of the 2015 #USOpen is almost up &amp; the big names of Serena, Venus, Djokovic, Murray, Federer &amp; Wawrinka are still in the draw..
@mmunro91 I may have never seen a player play a higher tennis level than I just saw, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic included. Make no mistake,.
Fognini is I believe only the 3rd one to beat Nadal 3 or more times in a year - the others (no points for guessing) Federer and Djokovic..
Federer breaks the Kohlschreiber serve!! Federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. Fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #USOpen.
Good starts for Federer and Stosur. Berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!.
Wow, tragic start from Federer in the 3rd.
Just like in the 2nd, Federer breaks back..
Roger while having trouble with serve, he is still through to 4th round! Federer might face Isner in 4th round.
@JohnIsner I concur with your coach. Its you! #AmexTennis Good luck tomorrow against Federer!.
Federer defeats Kohlschreiber 6-3 6-4 6-4 to go through to the 4th Round @usopen.
Federer advances into fourth round at US Open: In the blazing New York sun, Federer seems to be in his element... http://t.co/CoiDuhKlL4.
@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw Beep beep...! Yep, Murray and Federer into the top 16. Phew! :) See you tomorrow!.
Monday at the US Open: Murray, Federer &amp; Konta are all in action at Flushing Meadows today http://t.co/50ZM0cOEjT http://t.co/YlLS4kf0of.
Federer's second serve placement is awesome. That's why he's the best server ever. Nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve.
Gonna have to DVR this Isner and Federer match... This thing is good. Getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #USOpen2015.
Federer saved 4 BP (from 0/40) and holds for 2-2 in the 2nd set..
Ok time to check back in with tennis - Isner and Federer heading into a 2nd tiebreak.
Federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots..
Federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. Leads Isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) #usopen.
I watched Federer calmly destroy a dude at the US Open on Thursday, and it was amazing. I still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?".
I believe the loss at RG to Wawrinka was first time in a decade Federer didn't break once in a GS match. This might be the 2nd. #USOpen2015.
That ending of 2nd set TB by Federer, he really is the original son of Jor-el.
Wow, Federer wastes 3 bps with 3 Isner's 2nd serves. Fed 0/8 on bps tonight.
Federer's 1st serve is just...perfect. #USOpen.
Federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve... Lol wow.
@NerdistMom It's weird that in the 1st set Federer &amp; Isner went game for game until the tiebreak. Then Federer trucked him in the tiebreak.
Federer breaks his own record with a 14th appearance at the ATP Finals after reaching the US QF #FinalShowdown http://t.co/ugI3PQBp8w.
With his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure Federer will crush Gasquet in the QF. C'mon Federer!! http://t.co/LHCEhZo26g.

Hannibal has been the most amazing show on NBC. I really hope they get a 4th season. Bryan Fuller is amazing #Hannibal #HannibalFinale.

ok when I'm sober tomorrow I NEED to talk to people about Hannibal.
@afooltocry @HorrorHoneys It's my uneducated opinion that Breaking Bad is the best show in the history of time.Hannibal might now be the 2nd.
@neoprod @GillianA @NBCHannibal well you can't do this all by yourself ... Hannibal is inviting to Dinner and Will may finally accepting him.

I'm going to be so tired tomorrow but all I want to do is reblog Hannibal related stuff on tumblr. *cries* #Hannibal.
Binge watched Hannibal all night and I may have just checked under my bed for a killer. #adultlife.
@wylerette it may be called Hannibal but the show does revolve around the both of them plus bryan said they are meant to stay together.
We've got to wait until Wednesday night here in the UK for the Hannibal finale yet I've pretty much seen it all in gif form.
Tweet from the great state of Denial. New tv show called #Hannibal on thur at 10pm. The guy plyn Hannibal has good cheek bones. Im intrigued.
Tonights a good stopping point. Tomorrow I watch the last 6 episodes of Hannibal, ie. the Red Dragon arc..
I loved the Hannibal finale Saturday. It was good enough and open enough to interpretation to please all types of Fannibal. #HannibalMicDrop.

@DrHLecterMD @lecters_imago / You portray Hannibal beautifully may I just say..
@Amirabiabdallah Dexter is great but give Hannibal another try, it gets better after the 5th episode :p.
@filmgrabber Michael Marshall shot the hell out of the Hannibal finale. (This movie rules. Loving Maddin Monday).
OK so maybe I'm watching, for the 1st time, the 1st episode of the 1st season of Hannibal and OH MY LORD WHAT IS THIS.
@LowriBearman Thank you my love! And I have had a fab day! Distinct lack of Hannibal but I'll put that right tomorrow! xx.
I'll be sending off Summer and HANNIBAL tomorrow. It'll be a bittersweet day..
@JohnC1908 I pretty sure none of those fans regret not being there to see Harper strike out in the 9th on a pitch in the dirt..
I don't much like Harper but he is right to do this. https://t.co/CpgYEqFDzm.
Sherman or Harper: Who knows the strike zone better? My column: https://t.co/sTzFrXNXIN.
@BrianRoastbeef if you're interested... Mansbridge's Harper interview. Justin tomorrow, Mulcair Wednesday. http://t.co/hUJjpAgMZd.
C'mon... It's pretty hard to form the Harper govt without Harper!!! Wait... maybe they have another Harper...  https://t.co/VomvlAJAOT.
David Wright is a beast and Harper needs to come to Philly we will stay till the 9th if you play for us. @Bharper3407.
Bryce Harper is 0-18 against Matt Harvey. Harper will lead off the 3rd inning against Harvey. http://t.co/AdEeLdzeoJ.
Big spot for Harper now in the 7th to impress the fans left in the park.
@maryb889 Still have the 9th &amp; top of order!  Harper walkoff homer!.
OK, last chance for the #Nats. It's Werth, Rendon, Harper vs. Familia in 9th, down 8-7..
Werth, Rendon, and Harper due up in the bottom of the 9th, #Nats trail Mets 8-7..
I hope all the fans stayed into the 9th to watch Harper go 0-5. #nats.
#Nats Rendon bunts but Werth is erased at 2nd. Runner on 1st with 1 out.  Harper at bat....
@KoryCPC telling why you should trust Harper. Worth the 10 min. to listen. Not after eating, though.#cdnpoli http://t.co/zG540pZvIU #cdnpoli.
@SouthpawSlinger @jonmorosi @FOXSports @FS1 But he's certainly been the 1st or 2nd best player in the NL overall, Harper and Kershaw better..
@RedPorchReport Harper putting up historic numbers. Thus far it's been a series to forget at the plate, but, again, he didn't pitch the 7th..
@EvanLSolomon Harper gets first chance, most seats won get 2nd chance. Easy. Harper does not play well with others, ask Danny Williams..
@ian_wayne @P_Wog   Keep focus on Harper&amp; all these good things will be added unto you May the best man who wins the heart of Canadians.

#FF @innocent - not just for the drinks but for Jay-Z's 99 problems! 99 problems that we may just ponder about at some point in our lives!.
Sitting at a curb staring at the White House Listening to jay-z.thats a fine Friday.
For those who may not know, Jay-Z wrote the verses for Still D.R.E but he's never disrespected Dre or ever spoken about ghostwriting..
December 4th only cause I used the beginning in my Jay-Z speech for class https://t.co/5bw2R2xGvo.
Was hoping this would escalate to be something like Nas vs Jay-Z but Meek got KO'ed in the 2nd round lol.

My following may not be as big as Jay-Z's but I got a solid supportive growing following. Thanks for the love. #TeamM00Y0U.
the 1st dance at my wedding will actually just be a duet of Diamonds From Sierra Leone-Remix with my husband as Jay-Z and myself as Kanye..
Aye now Meek may surprise us. You know when Jay-Z dropped Takeover they thought it was over for Nas. And then Ether.......
May the best of your today be the worse off your tomorrow - Jay-Z.
#WEHO: @ChrisPipkinSC is leading the pack for a THE CARTERS: Lil Wayne, Beyonce, and Jay-Z ride Thursday at 5:30pm! Grab a bike!.

The best part of living in New York is the nightlife. The 2nd best part is knowing that Jay-Z and Beyonce share the same weather as me..
@SeaGlass4Nicole Today was a Jay-Z type of the day. Who knows what tomorrow will bring?.

Only looking forward to Kanye's performance at the VMA's tomorrow! Heard he's bringing out Rih, Bey, Jay-z &amp; Paul McCarthy.
I was certainly not expecting @JColeNC to bring @Drake and Jay-Z to the Ville.  I may have dropped a tear or two.  Greatest show ever!.
If Kanye became President, folk that wrote off the masonic/illuminati symbols in he and Jay-Z's music/vids as meaningless, may think again!.
Also the correct Top 5 is Eminem, Jay-Z, 2Pac, The Notorious B.I.G., and Ice Cube in that order with Big Pun as the 6th man.
I knew Jay-z was getting old but I forgot about Eminem. He looks 30 something! https://t.co/fFCMZvL6l9.
@MsTosciMarie Not really and I'm a huge Jay-Z fan. But, when March 9th come around? Biggie all day everyday.
The game 1st album 1 song he say he rap like Eazy-E then Nas then 50 cent then dr Dre then Jay-Z then Eazy-E again then like his dead bro.
May the Lord give you Jay-Z and Beyonce's kinda love... No way that relationship is fake or for social media.

Javier Saviola: "I'd be delighted if Messi won his 5th Ballon d'Or because of the quality of his football and because of our friendship.".
Messi has ALWAYS scored in the 1st or 2nd leg of the CL Round of 16 since the 2007/08 season: 2 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 6 - 2 - 1 (ongoing).
What a great cover for the 1986 winner....I feel @francefootball need to do something very special for Messi's 5th. http://t.co/ixSDV38UhN.
Messi and Ronaldo both go up a rating in FUT 16 with Messi a 94 and Ronaldo 93 Suarez is a 90 as 3rd best player in the game..
Hahah Lol so Halilovic was shaking when he saw Messi for the 1st time. I'ld probably faint if i ever meet him..
3-0 Lavezzi on fire w his 2nd goal. Too bad he couldn't do it in World Cup or Copa America. Crowd still chanting "Messi" #Argentina #Bolivia.
66' GOAL!!! #Argentina  Messi with a header makes it the 5th of the game  #Argentina 5-0 #Bolivia.
Whoaaaa...! #MESSI's show is on.. MESSI with the 2nd Goal... MESSI scored a brace. The greatest ever has destroyed them. #ARGvBOL.
@SivanJohn LOL the finishing was quite similar to Messi's 2nd goal against Bayern..
@LeslieeAndradee Messi scored with his 4th touch like omg! Like it's not fair..
James Rodriguez is fast closing in on the 2nd grade of best footballers (those immediately after Messi and Ronaldo)....
The 3rd goal scorer of Mauritania just became Messi right there passing five defenders....aowa Bafana Bafana.
@Safeeyar yap. That's why i dont understand why they're making fun with messi's height. Do they expecting him to be a Jan Koller? Lol.
Iniesta is the 3rd best after Messi and Ronaldo, no one comes close, not Neymar not Hazard #spain.
Imagine having a 20th of Messi's ability. You'd be the best in your team.
I told my dad I'm going to see messi on Tuesday , and he called me a bastard cuz he can't go.
Messi was just 20 years &amp; 161 days old when he secured a podium finish (3rd place) at the 2007 Ballon d'Or ceremony http://t.co/wwtDG2aWjb.
Nice to be in the @guardian_sport YouTube round up. Mine is the last link - Messi is the headline. Surely a mix-up?! http://t.co/KheYatUISH.
@ultrasuristic Thank you Kluivert. These days a lot of people make Ronaldo look like a Sunday League player when compared to Messi.....
Messi (back in January): 'My dream is to finish my career at Barcelona for as long as people want me'.
Initial pass to Messi zipped in. Only he could tame the ball &amp; pass to Xavi 1st time. Minimal backlift from another planet. @Phase_in_out.
I may not have gotten a picture of Messi, but I still saw him with my own eyes! Fuck what everyone else says lol.
@CulesAmericano Messi has the 6th best dribble succes rate (81%) in Europe's top 5 leagues this term of players to attempt 10+ dribbles.

Have uni tomorrow morning but need to say bae Messi tonight. its my drug..
Going to see Messi the magician play in November! #Campnou https://t.co/gl1iY9XZ7f.
And people still doubt @WayneRooney  absolutely comical. He may not be Ronaldo and Messi but he's our best player by a mile.
Messi will now attempt to break Telmo Zarra's record on 22 November when Barcelona face Sevilla at the Camp Nou.
@Badandy538_ At the end of the day,  we're talking about great players so any argument against may sound like nitpicking. Messi is GOAT tho..
Messi may be the best player in the world but Chicharito is the best player in the universe #ChichaDios @CH14_ http://t.co/BbPKl2CfGj.
he was level ffs! also, he may be a problem child but no Argentine forward links with Messi better than Tevez..
the crowds gonna go crazy when Messi comes in for the 2nd half.
Okay, I can see how you may not like lebron or Tom Brady but not Messi..this guy has nations on his back..
12:26am and we've got US Open Drama, Colbert's debut, and Messi just scored a sick goal for Argentina.  All Live/1st run now..
And that is why messi is the best in the world. Good game though. Now to wait till October 10..
And Argentina say Messi does nothing for the national team??! That goal was just magical Messi time as usual, c'mon! XD.
Messi has registered back-to-back hat-tricks (3+ goals) for Barcelona for the 3rd time in his career.
But Messi made the former premier league champions look like a group of 11 lads at goals  https://t.co/fAPDWwbX0d.

Preaching theme this Sunday: David &amp; Bathsheba -- with band doing cover of Sting's "Every Breath U Take (I'll be watching U)" #yeahbaby.
Retweet/Favorite if you want to see Masked Kane, Sting and The Rock return this Sunday at #SummerSlam! #WWEFamily http://t.co/coY9ouWlMj.
Sting's in Brooklyn. Sunday night, it's happening. IT'S HAPPENING! #SummerSlam.
[150823 Moo Party] Mamamoo sang Sting with live piano 1st then back to MR. Pictures/fanarts/messages from MooMoos were shown on the screen..
@lentzadam533 yea definitely but I just saw a report that Sting is coming to RAW tomorrow and Taker going be at raw could be interesting.
Rumor has it that Sting will appear on #RAW tomorrow night..
@Danielmmafan Sting could always have another match before. I just read hes gonna be on Raw tomorrow..
@FredRichani If you wanna do Rock vs Brock and Taker vs Sting at wm 32. Survivor Series on his 25th anniversary would be the place to end it.
Rumor Roundup (Aug. 24, 2015): Raw tonight, WrestleMania, Sting return, Divas Revolution, more! http://t.co/VRDROEKt0E via @cagesideseats..
And it all ends,  with Sting! Monday Night Raw, was absolutely, WAY more better, then Summerslam. #StingVsRollins  #RawBrooklyn.
That was one of the best Monday Night Raw shows I've seen in a while, finishing off with Sting! Could we see #RollinsvsSting.
Including his TNA title wins, Sting is a 14-time World Champion. Beating Seth would tie him with Cena for 2nd of all time. @wwe #raw.
great RAW tonight...1st the Dudley Boys and then to end with Sting!!!   #WWERaw #WWE.
Sting winning at #NightOfChampions results in either Sting vs Taker at Mania or Sting vs Cena and I've got a bad feeling it's the 2nd option.
Sting is back, and the Dudleys return :D Quite an eventful Monday Night Raw on the whole. Lesnar-Dallas though X'D #RawBrooklyn.
@ryan24672 @CMPuLs3 And it'd work, Seth getting the rub and being Sting's 2nd ever opponent + a month long reign with both titles is BIG.
@Chrissie32NY so tomorrow we should try &amp; plan a trip to see the next PPV as Sting might be world champ!!.
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/zDth0kovNW Seth Rollins vs Sting the Returns 2015 WWE Raw, Aug 24.
I honestly think I'm still Marking Out from last night's #RAW... 1st the Dudley Boyz...  Then Ric Flair... And then Sting!! :D #WWE.
@NickGator well, at least you can see Sting's 1st WWE title win for only 9.99.
Loving the Sting stuff &amp; especially loving the way Triple sold it all... STING WAS IN THE BOX! http://t.co/Kxr2yb69ze #RAW.
The Sting stuff just being great &amp; loving how Triple H sold the "big reveal"... http://t.co/Kxr2yb69ze #RAW.

HERE WE GO Monday Night Raw hopefully we get another good show tonight Sting vs Rollins at NOC should be really good #RAW.
I know Sting says this is Monday Night #Raw, but it feels a lot more like Monday Nitro to me.
Even if it's an announced segment, I still mark out when Sting is on my TV on Monday nights. #RAW.
And @TripleH may have " hand picked " @WWERollins but @StephMcMahon and Sting is right- Rollins is not half the man HHH is. #RAW.
Going on record, Sting wins belt at NoC, drops it at the MSG show on the 3rd. If I'm wrong, ya can have open season on me..
