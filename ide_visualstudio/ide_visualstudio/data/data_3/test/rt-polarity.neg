What makes the 3rd bailout different is that, after Tsipras, there will be no one left inside Greece to credibly manage the memorandum.
Tsipras: (on referendum) I Thought No was going to win, on Thursday. On Friday I was certain of it.
After all these Tsipras headlines, I wonder if they'll still let the Athens Stock Exchange open tomorrow. Will be a total bloodbath..
@NormalCommunity @Ypatia1 Thanks. I reckon Tsipras may be heading for the top three of the world's most disingenuous politicians..
@steve_hanke Tsipras is currently on holidays and on the 6th he is going to Egypt. So i dont think he realizes the situation we are in.
Tsipras - "talks are in final stretch"  which is Greek for "talks are about to break down and I may call a referendum any minute now".
No big deal, Tsipras reminds his admirers all over the world.  If possible, a 2nd emasculation won't be opposed by him..
@BritainFirst It's like Tsipras says, they're in the middle of a humanitarian crisis. BF should have their march cancelled, and the money.
@Hugodixon "more moderate" may be! But plenty of uneducated demagogs, who have not done a day's work....Starting  with Tsipras, himself!.
Keep in mind Tsipras' 1st state visit after elections was Pope Francis in the Vatican. @ma000111 Tsipras an atheist representing Orthodoxy..
Dont  underestimate the power of the pple, don't be sure Tsipras will win, many who voted Syriza the 1st won't now https://t.co/sfaYGW1k4n.
@maxseddon @gorianov #pt may come in handy if Medvedev has to have one of those talks with Merkel that Tsipras is so familiar with.
Elections seem the most probable scenario, as Tsipras made a strategic mistake... https://t.co/9wGXuyTyu2 #Greece.
@YanniKouts Tsipras may just limp across the finish line in the general election because there's no real viable alternative PM....
It would be a strategic mistake of the 1st order 4 Tsipras (let alone a genuine anti-austerity politician) to seek and maintain a leading ...
Tsipras seemed like a Teflon prime minister... But now it looks the mud is beginning to stick. by H.Dixon  https://t.co/u44xsBvfIB.
By capitulating to the Troika, Tsipras didn't just seal Syriza's fate, he may have sealed Podemos's too / http://t.co/pGjkdfD5hC.
@davidaslindsay @UKLabour my area is so safely labour, you could pin a red rosette on a Donkey&amp; it would still get voted in. Now UKIP is 2nd.
Far Left have one thing in common with UKIP mad conspiracy theory's about purges and they are the always victims  https://t.co/Nka4xuMPxt.
@fronteratech are you for real? UKIP supported austerity in their manifesto! in a byelection in Cornwall last night you went from 1st to 4th.
If you did not vote UKIP in May then you are a major part of the illegal immigrant problem and no part at all of the solution......
@martyj21 https://t.co/ulJsErILMH Idiots attracted to all parties. Difference with UKIP is media prepared to dig through years of profiles;.
There's a simple solution, just deport all the far right wing Tory &amp; UKIP voting cocksuckers ! https://t.co/kfAn0Z7S15.
@LordAshcroft went to UKIP and ppl wont be fooled twice with weasel words I wont vt 4 them again it will b 1st time in 70yrs DC deceitful..
@Independent Backed by The Sun &amp; closest to UKIP - What does this say about the UK electorate! Bigots United!.
FFS. Enough. Fuck the Daily Mail, The Sun, UKIP, Front National and all other reactionary purveyors of hatred.... http://t.co/jTrLHGCHxh.
@meldrum @iainmartin1 65-70% of Tory &amp; UKIP voters still want to renationalise the railways, as do the 1st &amp; 2nd place cands for Lab Leader..
@EyesWatchin you may not like Corbyn but to retweet UKIP supporters is worse. More tory than the tories.
May continues to disguise her "UK out of EU" view. She should do the honourable thing and resign and join UKIP. https://t.co/vQfaLYG4g6.
@sweeneyuk1 @roxley @DouglasCarswell @Telegraph that's the problem with UKIP, they want all other EU countries to put UK citizens above 1st..
Theresa May Calls For Curbs To EU Free Movement and usurps many UKIP ideas in the process: http://t.co/j1fZfP89pm.
@pperrin @nellesapelle Very wise. Hard to see UKIP going any further tho. Lab &amp; Tory split may open up new space like you said..
So Twitter, who do you think will be 1st Labour MP to announce they are leaving for UKIP on September 12th?? #JezWeCan.
My Ma's so fucking UKIP. She may as well be smoking Bensons and sipping John Smith's ale as she's giving off about the Chinese.
UKIP may be out of the news but they are as poisonous as ever https://t.co/5MI5s1BvDK One of their parliamentary candidates.
UKIP boy may have deleted his Twitter profile, but those screenshots will be with him forever..
@Tweet4Labour UKIP polled 2nd in Labour-held seats in the north, if we continue with Tory-lite policies then UKIP will crush us in the north.
@GudBadAnFozzy @davidsmith42000 @LBC You said he was the 2nd worst, he isn't &amp; UKIP don't vote on non-UK issues.
@paulwaugh to be fair Paul, after SNP, UKIP, Boundary changes &amp; 50 fewer MPs, it may not be leader that's influencing the 80% who disagree.
@BaronGraham I understand why people may support them, but I totally despise UKIP. They're racist bigoted beasts, nothing average about that.
The same ppl who voted UKIP in May are only defending migrants coming to the UK because it seems like the 'conscientious' or 'right' answer..
If there were an election tomorrow,UKIP still wouldnt get a great number of MP's,I hate to say it but I think this country is about finished.
Deplorable and wrong-headed comments by Bristol's only UKIP councillor. I hope he loses his seat in May and UKIP fold http://t.co/l4k1GggRlm.
@joerexrode Sorry, Joe, but the only way this team finishes 7th in the Big Ten would be major injuries to Valentine, Harris and Tum....
@steve196508 Evrn worse for people born around 14th November. Just the result of a Valentine's shag..
Valentine's day may be rather depressing for me but I barely get to see this....
I hope that guy goes all out for Valentine's Day. The fkn works. Then a few days before feb 14 he checks her phone, and sees a few messages.
One of the infinite reasons why valentine's day is the worst holiday in human existence https://t.co/rTXBO4Dj1x.
They think cause they said some vague shit on that Friday in December that when Valentine's day comes around and they're with another girl.
This was the last Sunday without #NFL #football until Valentine's day..
I think I posted surprise incest in the Golden Sun fanfic category once on Valentine's Day. I was a terrible person..
@ruraljules If it makes you feeling any better....I got dumped by my 1st boyfriend, by note, right before Valentine's Day. :\.
I get way too hype about October fuck February Halloween is my Valentine's Day.
Dumbass christian thought Valentine's Day was on the 13th... Bye.
Ruble sliding again today, with dollar cracking above 64 rubles, for first time since Valentine's Day in February. http://t.co/sL7ZYvAGC5.
But then i remembered she's the same hoe that never gave me a Valentine's Day card back in the 4th grade AND stole my scented eraser..
The world will end on February 14 in the year 2016. "Valentine's Day. Bummer." http://t.co/vDMMKsq82d.
900 Jews were burnt alive on 14 February 1349 in the "Valentine's Day" Strasbourg massacre, where the plague had not yet affected the city.
Get me Valentine's Day hearts for Feb. 14 and I'm taking it as a sign you're breaking up with me. Love won't make you eat those things..
This is the last agonizing Sunday of the year. No more of these until Valentine's Day..

I wonder if my 3rd attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 will be the charm. I sure hope so it's taking several hours for each attempt..
so the Windows 10 upgrade may mean that various assistive technology softwares financed by DSA don't work? Awh what? http://t.co/0ZISCtaIxm.
Photos may not come tonight. Updated to Windows 10, reset computer and now it doesn't remember which photos it has and is currently 1/2.
Intended to finish my Windows 10 slides for the Aug @NelaInfoSec event.  Couldn't connect SP3 to internet; gave up.  Must complete tomorrow..

So apparently Sony VAIO laptops pre-installed with Windows 7 probably won't receive Windows 10 drivers until after November. #uninstallahoy.
Fuck it, I think it may be time to give Windows 10 a try.  Once I finish this download, it's time to nuke this shit from orbit..
BEWARE - if you do not have to upgrade to Windows 10 you may want to think twice before you do. We would warn you... http://t.co/B1iSmtLihL.
I'm in the process of updating to Windows 10. Close your home windows, wherever you are.....my screams may soon be deafening..
Upgrading to Windows 10 may be the worst computer-related decision I've made since deciding to play Neopets instead of going to class..
1st blue screen of death in abt 7yrs and it happens aftr updating to Windows 10.Microsoft...*sigh* thought yall asses had it together by now.
Grandma's hiring some dude to work on her computer tomorrow.....  A bit worried.. he might try to get her to install Windows 10..
Serato DJ isn't compatible with Windows 10 yet :( ...got to spin on my old laptop Saturday..
Just spent 5 hours babysitting my 5th attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 without success. Not sure what's wrong, but it's getting ridiculous..
anyone having problems with Windows 10? may be coincidental but since i downloaded, my WiFi keeps dropping out. Itunes had a malfunction.
@AllAllen7 If the issue only occurs with Windows 10 and not your other PC or device. It sounds like the issue may be with Windows 10..
Upgrading to Windows 10. Might not be recording tonight after all. May need to cancel tomorrow night's stream to record Fable..
My AD/DA interface drivers just went BOOM!  It seems Microsoft is forcing me to upgrade to Windows 10. I may gone some time....
@squeejay this is on Windows 10, may have something to do with it; everything else is also slower than sh** through a funnel since 'upgrade'.
Microsoft needs to get their shit together. Xbox live just went down for a 2nd day, what a fucking surprise @XboxSupport  #xboxlive.
@XboxSupport abt time we got a reply from xbox 4 hours and counting, this is the 3rd time in a month what u doing to fix this issue xbox.
@thepieface I hate it more. My Xbox controller is in London so I can't play until sunday.
@MrTLexify my Xbox box live expired last Friday the struggle are real.
Just sitting here staring at my Xbox waiting for the #Destiny update to finish downloading. 30 + minutes. I may die waiting....
What will the Destiny 2.0 patch be at when I get home? 70% 48%? 95%? 2%? Who knows. My Xbox may just be on fire the way things were going..
@BungieHelp I've sat here since 7 its now 1am and it has moved 2% i'm off if it's not done when I wake I'll be ringing xbox for a refund..
@KonamiSupport yo wtf why can't you fix the severs on Xbox one for fob it's September 9th and again can't get on.
This may be our last chance to see Zlatan in the World Cup and FIFA totally fucked it up. Shocker..
Friend with connections just offered to let me meet Zlatan &amp; Co. in NJ tomorrow. Alas, my body sucks and I cannot..
So, about Zlatan... I don't want him. All reports are that he's not a good teammate. He'd be our 3rd DP Fwd, how do you work the 3 together?.
@OccupyBears he fancied rolling the ball to Zlatan on the edge of the box early on and then he totally fucked up for PSG's 1st goal....
fucking cunt. I hope he eats Zlatan's shit in retirement league. https://t.co/blH85NzExz.
@MinoRaiola just because your hunger for more money Zlatan will play in a team that finished at the 10th place and struggle for top 5,shame.
Watching a replay of the PSG / Lille match from Friday. No Zlatan makes PSG unwatchable..
@ACMilanNorway anyway, telling Zlatan he'll be the center of the team is like telling the sun it's the center of the solar system. No crap..
The top 4 strikers in the world are not for sale and our coach can't handle the 5th (Zlatan).
Today United should have done better, the referee didn't help at all!!!!  Rooney to 10 pls! Just sign Zlatan tomorrow pleeeeeeze.
If there is a silver lining this shows LVG if we dont buy anyone b4 Tuesday we is fucked!! Fuck it i would take Zlatan!!.
