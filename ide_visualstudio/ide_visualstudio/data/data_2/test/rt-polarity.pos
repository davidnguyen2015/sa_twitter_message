And it all ends,  with Sting! Monday Night Raw, was absolutely, WAY more better, then Summerslam. #StingVsRollins  #RawBrooklyn.
That was one of the best Monday Night Raw shows I've seen in a while, finishing off with Sting! Could we see #RollinsvsSting.
Including his TNA title wins, Sting is a 14-time World Champion. Beating Seth would tie him with Cena for 2nd of all time. @wwe #raw.
great RAW tonight...1st the Dudley Boys and then to end with Sting!!!   #WWERaw #WWE.
Sting winning at #NightOfChampions results in either Sting vs Taker at Mania or Sting vs Cena and I've got a bad feeling it's the 2nd option.
Sting is back, and the Dudleys return :D Quite an eventful Monday Night Raw on the whole. Lesnar-Dallas though X'D #RawBrooklyn.
@ryan24672 @CMPuLs3 And it'd work, Seth getting the rub and being Sting's 2nd ever opponent + a month long reign with both titles is BIG.
@Chrissie32NY so tomorrow we should try &amp; plan a trip to see the next PPV as Sting might be world champ!!.
I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/zDth0kovNW Seth Rollins vs Sting the Returns 2015 WWE Raw, Aug 24.

Rented #scifi #movie "The Edge Of Tomorrow" with Tom Cruise Friday. Really underrated. Hadn't enjoyed a new movie like that in quite awhile..
@andycastro @MiklCraw4d ok, so he can pretend he's Tom Cruise in born on the 4th of July and inspirationally drive his butt up here.
Sunday night is getting rowdy with a Tom Cruise marathon #WilsonTexts http://t.co/o34goCowHG.

Theresa May is laying down a marker for the Tory leadership. Tough on immigration and tough on the causes of immigration..
Mrs May doesn't mean it but just wants to be elected Tory leader when Dave steps down Then it will be all smiles @DSORennie @edwardlucas.
@pperrin @nellesapelle Very wise. Hard to see UKIP going any further tho. Lab &amp; Tory split may open up new space like you said..
Tory saw me with my physics textbook and she said "I wish you the best of luck may God be with you" y me hecho la bendicion.
Tory concerned about carding black kids and the traffic on the Gardiner.He'll speak to the press Wednesday about the Gardiner..
@AllenStarr1 @TrippyPip I'm a Tory voter. I agree with austerity. We are the 5th biggest economy in the world, we can afford to help.
Bought crumpets on the way home and thought "Ah, that'll make a nice Saturday morning!" Felt like a Tory voter somewhere in Surrey..
Tory in Wallingford on the 19th!!! Might have to swing thru!!!.
not a bit ashamed to say I have preplanned LOTS of jokes about the Queen/parasitology to troll my Tory royalist classmates tomorrow.
What is 'amazing',I shd add, is that I went through the University a Tory!Even belonged to Tory group at Uni!1st vote(21)Tory:since, Labour!.
Roll on Saturday and beyond ! Looking forward to an opposition Leader to REALLY fight the eternal enemy-THE TORY ! #Corbyn4Leader.
Trump is having a anti-deal rally at the capital tomorrow? Might have to pop by after some meetings tomorrow.
Remember that time people argued that we shouldn't kick Trump out of the 1st debate?.
Thank you for standing up for America. God Bless President Donald J. Trump! https://t.co/Jc3zk2i4fL.
Interesting about this. Trump keeps saying Cruz is joining him. I think Cruz started this and asked Trump to join. https://t.co/JVRVxUjuwp.
colbert on trump takes me to my comfort zone. may satire reign on #lateshow with #stephencolbert..
Wow! Trump! Gives you the best. Toronto. Splurge in November: Stay 4 nights Save 30% off your stay http://t.co/y1Tn8I6W3f #rich #famous.
Thank u for standing up for Israel Mr. Trump! What a refreshing change after the past 7 yrs. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  https://t.co/jqyyEan54g.
@MrMediaTraining Jeb! should be very happy. Colbert may be the one person who can reduce the Trump farce to size. He may diminish him..
First Colbert Show tonight. Jeb on. Sanders on Thursday. Trump on Fallon Friday. Should all be good for a few chuckles..
#TrumpCrab | Sierra Club http://t.co/yvg8h0CXYR - @Sierra_Magazine // You gotta see this! looks just like Trump..

@ChrisCuomo nevermind them, Chris.  I look forward to your interview with Trump tomorrow.  You and he mix it up and you both come off well..
Trump's greatest appeal is his abhorrence of political correctness. It's why he can win: http://t.co/YiNbvwChEK #ccot.
Trump has a strategy &amp; it's working. "The White Vote: The Rise of Donald Trump Shows It May Be Returning http://t.co/3C3vftEPZP via @usnews".

A long Put on Trump clinching the nomination with a long Call on the launch of a 3rd mainstream party... somebody? https://t.co/Mz2DQ2JM2W.
so folks, Trump has now lead consistently nationally and in every key state since beginning of july.  past history shows that wins it all..
It's nice that if Trump doesn't work out the GOP can fall back on Carson. https://t.co/Gn4jUdKT6e.
Trump: "We may have so much winning when I'm elected that you may get bored with winning." #winning..
I may not be for Trump becoming president but I am happy that he is for stopping the Iran deal..
@Hugodixon I would say Oct are early elections. If Tsipras doesn't hold them then, he will go the way of PASOK &amp; Samaras when held later..
@IrateGreek Correct! When 3rd memo voted and starts bighting in Tsipras likely to go the way of Pasok &amp; ND. Euro? 63% say don't fear drachma.
This man made up my mind to oppose #Brexit when he told Tsipras to hold his head high #betteroffin https://t.co/G4TFuxOMeM.
Tsipras looks to strengthen his authority after a party mutiny over the 3rd bailout http://t.co/Q1LwVZo0eC http://t.co/xqGo6QdfGo.
Greece's Tsipras bets on early polls to boost reform mandate: ATHENS, Greece (AP) ? Greece's president will launch the process Friday....
@Reuters The snap election will be on 20 September while the opposition groups such as Lafazanis led Popular unity or ND accused Tsipras.
Tsipras says that the September 20 elections will provide his party a strong mandate to form a majority government. http://t.co/pWzd4KhDmj.
Good (Greek) editorial/primer about upcoming Greek elections as polls show Tsipras on back foot http://t.co/Yy1HdH2DMc.
What a difference exactly two months can make. Tsipras faces crowds on 4 July v 4 Sep http://t.co/KZLMWiW9Qd.
@Reuters and Fofi Gennimata of Pasok,  as the recent poll also explicitly show, ND may be getting more popularity than Tsipras led Syriza..
Corbyn is popular with UKIP voters: maybe because he speaks straightforwardly like Nigel Farage? https://t.co/jGC6a8GSPk.

@Bunsolomopo Awesome, good selection there. Yeah i was up 13-18th. Saw Phil Wang, UKIP the Musical and some free stuff as well as Limbo.
