@Xbox @CallofDuty This looks like Edge of Tomorrow, the Tom cruise movie....
The Action flick Kings, Tom Cruise, Jeremy Renner needs to sharpen this aspect of his acting. He may turn out to be a fine poster boy for it.
I disagree with people who think you learn more from getting beat up than you do from winning. - Tom Cruise http://t.co/4h0hbCxHFm.

@RossoneriBlog oh c'mon, you all know exactly what i meant. I never said Zlatan should be benched in 1st place. It's about possibilities..
@hello_noto01 Zlatan!  Cavani has been unhappy about playing 2nd fiddle to Ibrahimovic... He's signing a new contract! Zlatan to MUFC?.
#ManUnited #transfernews Ronaldo -Ramos - Zlatan - Muller .If you could pick one to sign tomorrow , who would it be ? http://t.co/SIPAgVJjLm.
LOL Aulas still mad about the penalty Zlatan took a 2nd time a few month ago. I'm delighted by the fact that he is still butt-hurt about it!.
Further: Zlatan is the captain of the Mon-Stars. (The plot involves him recruiting demons to take over world soccer)..
@Jon_LeGossip Thoughts about the aubameyang rumors? Cover if Zlatan leaves? Or adding depth? Augustin a good 3rd Striker for UCL quality?.
Non issue"@itsKiragu: Man U playing against PSG on Thursday, niggahs will get thrashed like shit, Zlatan and Cavani gonna castrate you".
One word from Zlatan and he will keep quiet  "@Crhedrys Lmaoooooo Hazard 3rd best? Make Zlatan catch Mourinho fes.".
so is Zlatan gonna play the 2nd half for us or nah?.
replace Zlatan with Harry Kane on 8 Aug.. #Doomed  https://t.co/jwZ5gSASRG.
@mattoak I still say it's Monday after Zlatan finishes game on Sunday... They're just prepping. They'll tease enough to gather the media..
Zlatan is a doubt for Friday's game at Lille with sprained ligaments in his knee. He had to be strapped up during the game last night. #PSG.
@JenniferWegerup Hey Jennifer. What is your source for your article about Zlatan will be in Istanbul on the 6th of aug. Thanks a lot..
@_mindy_ @RetroUnited coz of Zlatan talking how he loves a fight. May make him show LVG just how he is truly world class..
Ibra recovery time is still unknown, the French League starts on Friday. PSG will play Lille, Zlatan is very much in doubt for that..
@DivinityHope Sure, someone who scored more goals than Zlatan and Edinson would be 4th string lol you retard.
@MilanEye I didn't buy your club to invest in Zlatan. I shall visit China tomorrow &amp; gift you a china-made zlaCHAN  8) #Taekwondo #staycalm.
@MrTransferNewss @FootbaIISources considering I'm 31st, it looks like Zlatan's about to disappear..
Zlatan's 20th goal of the season not enough for who concede twice late on to draw 2-2 with Caen....
@nananavy That &amp; Zlatan insisting on playing through pain for the 2nd half vs. Lyon. Why not just come off? 2-0 up anyway..
@Jon_LeGossip Any truth to Galatasaray having made an informal offer to PSG for Zlatan? Is he fit to play this Sunday?.
OH NO, we supposedly pull out of Pedro deal as Zlatan becomes available. Please god I'll go church every Sunday if u make this not happen.
@LiLHammy97 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of De Gea. But not enough time rather try for Griezmann. Wont mind Zlatan for a year !.
@Jon_LeGossip I didn't think they will sell either. Maybe Rabiot but surely Cavani doesn't want to play 2nd fiddle to Zlatan anymore.
@Keith_Russell I don't want it to be but it may be Austin. Obviously prefer Zlatan, muller, Lewandowski etc #mufc.
We held talks with PSG on Thursday for Zlatan name now confirmed to me but this is two days old news.
If Wenger is in Paris. Could it be for Cavani or Zlatan?Then again he may be on a family break..
Goal level: Zlatan  90k by Friday? = Posting every other day  #DSGS (Vine by @ElexAuerbach) https://t.co/BPUM3A8tSD.
@YouAreMyArsenal Wouldn't surprise me if we enquired.He can't be 100% happy playing 2nd fiddle to Zlatan but he's not worth PSG asking price.
Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC.
Noooooo! I was hoping to see Zlatan being Zlatan in Tuesday! Oh well, still looking forward to the match.  https://t.co/swGyd9cQAJ.
